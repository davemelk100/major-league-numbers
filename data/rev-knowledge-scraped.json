    "text": "Formerly of New Haven, Connecticut, it is now based in Huntington Beach, California. It was founded in 1987 by owner Jordan Cooper, along with Ray Cappo of Youth of Today, with the sole intent of producing the Warzone Lower East Side Crew 7-inch. Within the year, they put out two more releases and a limited 4th pressing of Youth of Today's Can't Close My Eyes 7-inch, which had been originally released on Positive Force Records, just for the two of them to trade for vintage G.I.Joes and other action figures. In the first three years, the label put out 23 releases and pressed approximately 50,000 records, and it has continued to release an average of 7–8 albums a year. Cappo left the business in 1988, to focus on his band Shelter. He also started his own label Equal Vision Records (which he later sold to Youth of Today roadie, former Revelation employee and friend, Steve Reddy), though his albums were still released by Revelation after that, and he also operated Supersoul Records. The label put out several definitive hardcore and metalcore records in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with notable releases coming from Damnation A.D., Will Haven, Shai Hulud, Curl Up and Die, and Himsa. However, by the mid-2000s, Revelation Records had seemingly fallen by the wayside, with very few releases between 2004 and 2006. However, the label is returning to its former stature as a premier old-school hardcore label with strong releases from newer bands like Down to Nothing, Shook Ones, and Sinking Ships.",

    "text": "Revelation Records | Skip to content Revelation Records The classic straight edge hardcore record label. Theres something about Rev collecting that has transcended multiple generations of hardcore kids and all the different fads and trends. It seems that even when the oldest collectors move on and sell large portions of their collections, the Rev stuff remains. Or at the least, its the last to go. Theres just something almost mythical about the quest to complete the early Rev catalog. From the Chung King, to a numbered Warzone b-side label, to Batman/Superman stamps, to a Chain silver sleeve Theres just something holy grail-ish about the early Rev stuff. Rather than clutter this page with a bunch of pressing information, please refer to the definitive Revelation pressing info page maintained by Kevin Finn if you have any questions about the rarity. Enjoy the photos! REV-000 Youth Of Today Cant Close My Eyes 7 on Orange vinyl Though not an official Revelation release, Im starting with this because Ray and Jordan at Revelation released this Orange vinyl copy of the Youth Of Today 7 right around the time of the early REV #1-3 singles. The Cant Close My Eyes 7 was originally released in 1985 on Kevin Seconds (7 Seconds) label, Positive Force Records. Ray and Jordan used the original plates to press 100 Revelation copies on orange vinyl to trade for toys, like GI Joe action figures, among other things. Later in this photo documentary, youll see several early Revelation advertiseme",

Most of these orange vinyl copies have batman or superman stamps, to represent the trade for toys. Mine has Batman stamps and the labels are hand-written. See the close-up below. BATMAN in color. What grows up while growing down? A duck. Haha, weirdos. I dont think I get it. I kinda do, but, not really. Also note batman stamp on the labels, and the sweet dinosaur stamps, haha! I swear to god I had a complete set of dinosaur stamps just like these when I was a kid. I was crazy into dinosaurs! I would have been 7 years old when they were stamping these things, so its very possible I had the same sort of stamp sets around that time, ha! This photo just shows the Batman stamps on each of the three components cover, dust sleeve, and record labels. While were at it, lets cover the rest of the versions of Cant Close My Eyes. The first copy shown is a first pressing black labels, red lettering. 2nd copy is 2nd pressing blue labels, white lettering. See below for close-ups and descriptions of the other two copies with white labels. This is a close-up of the Some Records pressing. These 100 copies had blank labels and were hand stamped with Some Records stamps and sold exclusively at NYCs local record store, Some Records. The record store was run by this dude Duane. That ties in nicely with another white label copy, described below. Close-up of the Some Records stamp detai",

    "text": "l. This is a strange variant which has a 2nd pressing blue label on the a-side, but a blank white b-side label with a hand-written message. Supposedly the band found a few of these while on tour, wrote random things on the labels, and sold them at shows. Mine has a hand-written b-side label: Duane is the hardest dude in N.Y.C. obviously referring to Duane from Some Records! This copy also has a cool old YOT sticker, printed old-school style: really shitty b w printing on a peel away backing. Ive also seen variants of this 7 with have blank white labels on BOTH sides with hand-written messages. These could be Some Records pressings that never got stamped, or they could be random plant mistakes like mine above, who knows. Heres a nice close-up of the hand-written b-side label, repping Duane hard! The same insert was used with all pressings of the Cant Close My Eyes 7. REV-001 Warzone Lower East Side Crew 7 Check out that 1st pressing white label copy. This is the very first piece of vinyl Revelation ever pressed (excluding a Warzone test pressing, of course). These were somewhat of a pressing mistake the labels were supposed to be blue labels. Its called the aborted press because they stopped production and switched the white labels to the blue labels. There are only 41 of these things and it is one of the most impossible Rev rarities to find. It may be hard to see in the picture but the 1st pressing blue label copy has a small 038 number on the b-side of the label. No ones tot",

    "text": "ally sure how many were numbered. Speculation has been maybe the first 100? The two copies in the upper right hand corner are 2nd pressing 500 on orange, 500 on black. The 3rd pressing green vinyl is one of the more rare Revelation colored vinyl pressings only 200 made. The 3rd pressing had blue lettering on the front cover, with the label art changing to feature the Rev star. You will find some 3rd pressing covers have 2nd pressing vinyl and vice versa. The first of my blue lettering copies has 2nd press vinyl with the star background labels. The second blue lettering copy has the 3rd press vinyl. The copy in the bottom right hand corner that looks like it has Red lettering is actually just colored in with a marker. I got this copy as-is, so I couldnt tell you if it was just an owner over the years being weird and coloring it in, or if one of the band guys did it originally. Who knows. But it is not the red lettering cover that accompanies the clear vinyl copies (clear vinyl not pictured because I was never able to hunt down a clear vinyl copy). This copy features a 2nd pressing cover with 3rd pressing vinyl. 1st pressing label compare: aborted press white labels out of 41 vs. blue labels with numbered b-side label #038 stamped on label. Possibly the first 100 were stamped, but no one is sure? Note how the label art has changed over the years From the the 1st press blue hand drawn labels, to an early version of a star background design, then finally later pressings represent",

Both of those have orange paper inserts, printed on two separate 8.511 sheets. Im not sure if there was a rhyme or reason to when they used the orange paper inserts, because Ive also seen eBay auctions for black vinyl 2nd or 3rd press copies that have an orange insert. REV-002 V/A Together Compilation 7 Yup, thats a test pressing of the Together comp on the left! One of the single most sought after pieces of Revelation history. I think Ive only seen one other Together test ever floating around out there, so this thing is very difficult to get. It has some penciled in writing on the blank labels that lists the bands GB, SOIA, YOT, SBS, Warzone, Supertouch, etc. I included a close up so you can see the penciled in band names. All versions of this 7 had an insert that was printed double-sided on two big 1117 sheets of paper. So it folds up pretty thick. Ive always loved that hand drawn basketball player (anyone who knows me duh.) on the Supertouch section, so I displayed that section of the insert. The photo also shows the color difference between 1st pressing orange vinyl out of 400 (sometimes referred to as gold vinyl) vs. 3rd pressing yellow vinyl out of 100. My yellow vinyl copy is #006/100 on the inside of the cover. Super early number, kinda cool. The 2nd pressing black vinyl copies can be den",

    "text": "oted with that weird yellow-ish paper insert (no, its not just white paper that has weathered over the years). 4th pressing covers can be denoted by an obvious photo copied cover with the photos detail appearing washed out. My 4th pressing copys insert isnt printed on 1117 paper. Its printed on 4 separate double-sided 8.511 pages. I dont know if all of them were like this, or if this is some weird bootleg insert because the original got ruined or what. Close up of the original Together 7 test pressing. Labels feature the band names written in pencil. 3rd pressing yellow vinyl with 006 stamp to denote #6/100. Super early number pretty cool! This is the rarest version of the Together comp. I never even knew this, but the b-side of the Together 7 also has a stamp on it! I recently sold this record and the guy who bought it was nice enough to email me these photos. Even after all these years of owning it, I had never noticed it before, becuase it has faded so badly. But look closely youll see a faint 070 stamp on the top leg of the big silver star. Its definitely the same stamp used on the Warzone b-side label (mine was 038), as well as the 006 on the inside of this 7 cover. I dont know why the numbers 006 and 070 dont match Im sure its just a case of them numbering the vinyl and covers separately. Close-up of each 1117 insert.

All of the SOIA 7 covers have the band name in red lettering, except for the Gilman sleeve which has black lettering. These were printed for a Gilman record swap way back in 1988! There are actually 3 Gilman sleeves pictured here. The 3rd copy is a Gilman sleeve, but the inside cover only has the stamped number it does not have the special Gilman limited ed. stamp. The 4th copy is identical, but the inside cover has the full number and Gilman stamp. I also took a close-up photo which shows the two copies comparing with and without Gilman stamp. The 9th copy also has a Gilman sleeve. This one came out with clear vinyl on Record Store Day in April 2010. Rev had 83 Gilman sleeves left over from 1987, and threw these on 83 of the 500+ clear vinyl copies. 23 years later! Pretty cool. Another cool thing to note youll notice the copy in the upper right hand corner has the cover photo cropped so it appears closer. This was only done on these 4th pressing copies. All other pressings have the same original depth to the photo. The grey and white vinyl were pressed in the late 90s/early 2000s, with different inserts and label art. You may also notice that the most recent 2011 pressings (bottom right hand corner) have returned to the original label art, and actually also returned to the original mix/master of this recording.

It also mentions that they wont ever advertise a release until they have the records, haha. It references the NYHC: The Way It Is LP currently running late as well not out till Feb 1st, despite the back of this flier saying Jan 1st. See below for photo of the back side. Whats funny about this ad is not only did the little note above say the NYHC LP comp was running late but it must have run really late, because its listed as Revelation #4 on the flier above, but it came out as Revelation #7! The 1st pressing on black vinyl and 2nd pressing on red vinyl are both stamped/numbered, with black vinyl copies being #1-1000 and red vinyl copies #1001-2000. The cover of my 2nd pressing red vinyl has come un-glued over the years, so that is the only way I was able to take a photo of the stamped number, since its on the inside of the glued pocket sleeve (they obviously stamped them before glueing them). Mine is #1615. Compare: two different 3rd pressing Gilman Street copies. Both are numbered out of 300. But only one copy has the actual stamp to denote the record swap on 06/26/88 held at 924 Gilman St. in Berkeley, CA.

The insert on the left has the band name in red ink on the upper left corner, as well as the names of the individual band members in the bottom right. These were used on the 1st and 2nd pressings. The 3rd and 4th pressings had the same insert, but no more red ink, just black and white. They probably just felt like it wasnt worth paying for multi-color printing if its only the band name in color anyway. The later pressings have the altered insert on the right. The trade list in the bottom right hand corner was included in the pic just for fun. These came with early pressings. When I originally posted the Schism Records blog entry, Chris Daily emailed me with this great information about the brown-ish paper on the Project X 7 being the same for the 1st pressing SOIA insert (thanks Chris!): Maybe useless info and maybe cool tidbit.I just happened to notice the write up on the PX cover paper, you will also notice that the 2 color SOIA lyric sheet (2 colors was just something I did in school, rest of the pressing it was not cost effective to do 2 colors), the Side By Side Lyric sheet and the NFAA lyric sheet are all the same paper..I printed them for Rev (and Schism) while in High School so all the paper should be the same.

The insert on the left was the first version, but for some reason after a couple pressings, they decided to transpose the photo across a vertical axis, i.e. a mirror image type thing. So the flipped the entire insert around, with the band members photo now on the right hand side of the insert. The problem? You cant transpose photos if there is text appearing in the photo, otherwise it will appear backwards!! Look closely at Civs HARVEY sweatshirt in the upper right hand photo. The text is backwards. So the next time they re-printed inserts, they fixed it by simply sliding the photo from left to right, instead of transposing it like a mirror image. The fixed insert is shown as the bottom copy in the photo. Just for fun, I included a photo of my GB wallet. My friend Ryan got this for me when his band, Ceremony, played with Gorilla Biscuits in Europe during one of GBs reunion tours.

Im not sure whats up with the old faded text that you can see on the labels. Maybe the pressing plant had a bunch of old messed up labels that didnt get properly printed, so they used them for test pressing labels? The original insert design stayed the same for all 3 pressings. However, notice that the 1st pressing insert was printed on the same brownish paper as the original Project X 7 cover! The 1st pressing inserts for the Sick Of It All and No For An Answer 7 also use this same paper. I got this info from Chris Daily, who printed them for Rev when he was in high school. I also posted the 12 version that Rev made in the late 90s. There are only 100 on blue vinyl and these are surprisingly hard to get! The black vinyl has been repressed many times, but the very first pressing on black vinyl was out of 1109 copies.

Talk about heart breaking on both sides. So now, I guess theres probably only 7 of these. Another view from a different angle Accompanying the test are the elusive red and blue pressings of this LP. I absolutely love the ice blue color on the blue vinyl copies yet another weird shade thats never really been duplicated very often. Wishingwell pressed 150 of each color, but while the band was in NYC for a show at CBGBs, their van was broken into and everything was stolen. A few copies had made it out of the van for sale already, and the label had sold some in SoCal and hung onto some others, but its estimated that there couldnt be more than 50 on each color really available. Of course, those copies that were stolen could have made it into circulation, but with the rarity of these things seemingly impossible to get, we all really doubt it. They probably just ended up in a dumpster somewhere Youll also notice a copy of the weird 2nd pressing on Wishingwell with the black and yellow cover.

The yellow/black label colors were also changed along with the jacket and insert. Anyway on to the actual Revelation pressing of the record! In 1988, Revelation repressed the LP using the new blue and yellow cover, which is what you see in the top row of records in the original picture. Unfortunately, I missed out on a first press testing pressing on eBay back in 2008 it had the Electrosound labels, the pressing plant used on the early Rev LPs (example: my 1st pressing Bold Speak Out LP test). The 1st pressing has the classic two-tone colored labels that Revelation used around this time period on all of their LPs. I actually own two copies of the 1st pressing with blue/yellow labels, as seen on the first row of the main photo. The difference is simply this Loaned For Promotion Only stamp on the back of one copy.

The 3 black vinyl copies in the middle row all come in a gatefold cover, but the vinyl is differentiated by slightly different matrix etchings.

Only 200 of the 500 clear copies have the silver sleeve, but Revelation still has most of these in their vault, so these things are a bitch to find. The silver sleeve is a nice slick looking variation of the original cover, and it just adds to the lore of this 7. Ive only owned mine for about 3 or 4 years. Props to my old buddy Seb for helping me make that a reality. The crown jewel in the photo is obviously the Chain TTD 7 test pressing! There are only 8 of these, and there was only 1 set of test pressings ever made, so there are literally only 8 copies of the TTD 7 that someone could claim to be a test pressing. I got this 7 in the largest, most epic record trade Ive ever executed. It was a trade with Geoff TDT. I never disclose all of the details of trades because I dont want ",

But I felt this trade was super equal for both of us and we both got records we were super psyched on. To give the magnitude of the trade, I scored this Chain 7 test, Necros IQ32 Skate Park sleeve, a Warzone numbered b-side label, and an original test pressing of the Alone In A Crowd 7 on Flux. I think it was awesome we were able to work out such a huge and complex trade in this day and age of eBay, etc (2009 or 2010, I believe). Close-up of the test pressing label, with date it was pressed 12.16.88. For some reason someone blacked out the Rainbo Records logo on the labels. Not sure why!

Just showing that sweet tri-fold layout, and comparing the classic green layout with the silver sleeve. The inside of the classic layout vs. the silver sleeve. In the mid 90s, Rev released a 12 version which includes both Chain 7s, along with an unreleased song Impact. That song rules In fact my band, The Damage Done, covered it a couple times. There was a bunch of controversy about this 12, because all of the songs sounded dramatically different from the 7s. The band claimed it was just a re-mix and re-master, but a lot of people swore they had gone in and re-recorded all the songs, and had recently written this song Impact just for thi",

But a lot of folks out there still think its BS and they really did re-record the songs. Im not much of a conspiracy theorist, so I doubt any of that happened. But hell, who knows, I dont really care. Anyway, Rev first released 312 copies on green vinyl, and the rest were black. Later they did a repressing in 2001 with 440 on grey vinyl. Youll notice the 2 different black vinyl copies. They are almost identical, but the cover is printed on a different type of stock, and the green colored bars on the insert are 2 different color greens. See the photo and description below. The original 1st pressing had the bright kelly green printed on the insert, but the later pressings have more of an ugly lime green color. This was just something I noticed on my own, and isnt mentioned in Revelation pressing info or anything. The reason I know for sure is the green vinyl copy (definitely first press) has the kelly green on the insert. This should be a valid way to determine if your black vinyl copy is an original first pressing out of 3,023 or a later re-pressing. Hey look, a cassette tape! Remember those? Even though the What Holds Us Apart 7 did not come out on Revelation, Im including it here since it was included on the 12 version of this release shown above. The very first pressing of this 7 was 45rpm and out of 500 copies. All 500 copies were rejected, and p",

Who knows if a large portion of the other 400 were destroyed, or if all 400 are still sitting around out there, gradually getting floated out there with some of these random covers.

Later, Foundation sold the 2nd press to Mindpower Records, which you see on the 2nd row with different label art. There were 200 with blue covers, 800 with yellow covers.

I was born in 1980, so if only I had been into hardcore when I was about 8-11 years old (1988-1991), I probably could have seen some pretty neat Chain shows during those summers in the Inland Empire and Orange County, haha. This advertisement was printed on the back of the stationary. Yo its fucked up that hoodies were $25 in 1990, and most bands are still stuck selling them at $25 in 2011, or $30 if theyre lucky. I guarantee blank garment prices have more than quadrupled since then. Hardcore sometimes just screws itself over. Heres one of those 45rpm pressings that have leaked out that were not part of the original 100 Chain Crew copies. Someone made a photo copy of the cover and insert from the real Foundation 7 release.

This photo compares the back-cover of all three pressings of the European release on First Strike Records in the UK. 1st pressing are hand-numberd out of 1500, 2nd pressing just has text denoting it, 3rd pressing doesnt have anything. Interesting thing to note about the inserts of the First Strike release. 1st and 3rd pressings have lyrics actually printed on the inside of the fold-out sleeve. Only the 2nd pressing has a blank inner fold-out sleeve, and an additional printed insert. Heres a note that came with the first pressing of the First Strike release, explaining the delays, and also lists the pressing info.

I know mine arent as pink as Id like them to be, so I say theyre mixes. But my orange/pink copies are both pretty nice mix copies, compared to others Ive seen. The first photo doesnt show it very well because of the lighting in the room when I took the photo after dark. See the photo below for a more accurate representation. This photo is a much more accurate representation of what my orange/pink mix copies look like when compared to the regular orange vinyl copy. The b-side label on my black vinyl copy of the 7 is mis-printed so the text runs off the label. Just a random little variation I figured Id note here.

It was worth over like $100, even in the mid to late 90s, and that was a LOT for a record. I remember feeling like the GB record must be a classic if a pressing on purple vinyl out of 1,015 copies (not all that rare) was worth over $100! There was just always something big about the GB on purple. I think Ill always think its cool to own GB on purple and Judge on green. 🙂 The 1st pressing of the GB LP has really cool embossed lettering, which basically means the letters raise up off the cover a little bit. Both the purple and black copies you see in the top row have embossed lettering. Later pressings dont have embossed lettering. I have noticed only one difference in the thousands of black vinyl represses over the years the background color behind the song lyrics on the insert changed from a black background on the early pressing(s) to a white background for later pressings.

REV-014 Judge New York Crew 7 This Judge 7 was first released on Porcells own Schism Records as SKIZ-2 (the Project X 7 was #1). Schism did 3 pressings of 1,000 copies each. Later it was released on Rev, starting out with an Orange cover and Orange insert. They used the same plates, so the early pressings of the Rev copies still have Schism matrix etchings. Over time some of the Rev copies got scratched out Schism matrixes, and eventually new plates were made and several variations and combinations exist with different matrix etchings and even 33rpm vs. 45rpm. I have one copy that is somewhat of a reject press or something it plays at 33rpm on the A-side side and 45 rpm on the B-side! Weird.

REV-015 Judge Bringin It Down LP So this is the album that has made collectors go wild for years. Originally recorded at Chung King studios, ultimately rejected by the band, and re-recorded later with Don Fury. Jordan needed to re-coup some cash from the original recording, so he pressed 100 (actually 110) on white vinyl, screened the Chung King Can Suck It covers and voila, a legend is born. Mine is #39. This is one of the most sought after pieces of straight edge hardcore collecting. Maybe THE single most sought after piece. Even the green vinyl copy out of 712 copies is somewhat of collector lore.

Im sure someone will chime in and set me straight on this one. But I thought this was cool I only noticed this as I was taking the photos for this blog Id never really noticed or thought about it before! Included with the test pressing was the original layout specifics/instructions/order form that Jordan or Ray sent in to the printing plant for the 7 covers. Its cool to see this sort of stuff and how they used to have to lay everything out manually and include instructions, instead of the modern day method where you just submit digital art files.

The 1st pressing copies have a more flimsy paper sleeve. Most of the later pressing black vinyl copies are printed on heavier glossy cardstock, and all seem to be about the same. But I have found this weird pressing that has a turquoise insert. Theres no mention of it on the Rev site, so I dont know how many were pressed. Later they pressed 300 on gold vinyl in 2002, then recently 1103 on blue vinyl for Record Store Day on 04/11/2011. Most pressings, including the original first pressing, have a black and white insert. But I have found a pressing that has this weird turquoise insert. Its not mentioned in the Revelation pressing info, so Im not sure what is up with it. I imagine they had an idea that maybe there were going to try to match the color on the cover art? I dont know, seems like a really strange color to make your entire layout. Ah, the 90s. haha. REV-019 Inside Out s/t 7 There were 1,000 blue and 4,000 black for the first pressing of the Inside Out 7. It had a full color insert with blue tinted photos, and the 7 cover does NOT have a bar printed across the top (the front of the cover is actually just shorter than the back cover). The 2nd pressing still has the full color insert, but youll notice the 7 cover is distinctly a darker blue/grey check out the 3rd copy on the top row. It has a white bar actually printed",

    "text": " at the top of the 7 cover, so the front and back cover are the same size. This is a pressing that is not mentioned on the Rev site, nor do most Rev collectors seem to notice that it exists. I happened to notice a difference in sleeve color on an eBay listing one time and picked it up for a couple bucks. Later black vinyl copies have a blue bar printed at the top (bottom row, 1st copy), and different insert art that is printed only in black and white. In 2002, Rev pressed 350 on white vinyl these have the white bar at the top again. Both of these covers have the early insert with blue photos, but its clear that they are a different pressing due to the fact that the copy on the right is so much more grey than the first pressing. The copy on the right also has a white stripe printed at the top of the cover, wheras the first pressings do not have a stripe the front of the cover is just shorter than the back, so what appears to be a white stripe on the left copy is actually just the non-printed backside of the back cover. Originally I thought only the first pressing copies had the full color blue insert, but since this copy on the right also has that same insert, it looks like the full color insert was used for more than just the very first pressing. Comparing the different inserts over the years. The top insert is full color with band photos in blue. This was used on the first pressing, as well as at least a second press (see blurb above about the covers), if not more pressings.",

    "text": " Then they switched to the black and white insert shown on the bottom this has been the standard insert on many pressings of the Inside Out 7 for years and years. REV-020 Judge There Will Be Quiet 7 The first pressing was 1,000 on gold vinyl, 4,000 on black vinyl. I imagine it was repressed at some point, but then again maybe not. For some reason there are 2 slightly different inserts within the first pressing itself. One has lyrics in the upper left hand corner. The other only has the Judge logo with no lyrics. I placed the inserts behind the vinyl in the photo below so you can see the difference. The insert difference is noted on Kev Finns pressing info page, but it doesnt explain why it happened. Heres a better look at the two different versions of the insert. Since the two different versions appear with my gold vinyl copies, that confirms that both of these inserts were most definitely printed around the same time, if they were able to be included in the first 1,000 gold vinyl copies. I have no idea why they would have pressed two different inserts right away. Unfortunately the Rev discography doesnt seem to remember why either! REV-021 Supertouch The World Is Flat LP Apparently this was only pressed once 3,015 on black vinyl. So theres not much to show. REV-022 Burn s/t 7 I actually owned a test pressing of the Burn 7 at one point, but I traded it away.

I think the owner who I originally bought it from told me that he bought it from a record store in NYC for that price back in the mid-90s. Anyway, the first pressing had 1,000 on pink vinyl and 4,000 black vinyl. Like most Rev pressings, it had a full color printed insert. Notice the yellow outlined inserts on the first two copies. But later pressings switched to black and white. The first copy on the bottom row has the black and white insert, with New Haven, Connecticut address on the back. The middle copy is exactly the same, but has the HB, CA address on the back. Lastly, 1090 copies were pressed on yellow vinyl for Record Store Day on 04/11/2011. Here is the photo of the Burn 7 test pressing. I believe the guy I originally bought it from said hed bought it at a record store in NYC for $16 in the mid 90s, thus the price tag type thing. Full color inserts came with the first pressing only. All subsequent pressings got black and white inserts. REV-023 Ray and Porcell s/t 7 Eh, weird deal. Ray and Porcell plus a drum machine. First pressing was 1,000 copies on purple vinyl, 4,000 copies on black vinyl. Like most Rev releases, the first pressing came with a full color insert, but later pressings had a condensed black and white insert. In the early 2000s, Revelation hand numbered the final 100 copies of vinyl that did not have covers, and made this purple photo-copied sleeve mine is #64/100. This is the perfect 7 to w",

But as far as complete Rev collection, I stopped at REV-23. REV-53 Good Riddance / Ignite Split 7Good Riddance split with Ignite, on Revelation Records. This split was destined to happen, with both bands having this vibe of surfer-bro-hardcore-on-the-fringe-of-mainstream-music. Im not taking a shot at anyone I always liked both bands and Im feelin it! haha. 1st press = 2000 black vinyl, 2nd press = 2000 green vinyl, then there was a later press in ~2001 on red vinyl out of 330 (I never had that one).

Back cover REV-59 Youth Of Today Were Not In This Alone LP The second Youth Of Today LP is their best LP. A lot of people would definitely argue with me, but I think Were Not In This Alone kills the Break Down The Walls LP. The recording is way better, the song writing is tighter, and they seemed to step up their guitar work by adding in some extra second guitar stuff. The first row is the original release on Caroline Records. Both black vinyl copies are identical, except for the 2nd one has Mix #2 etched in the matrix to denote a re-mix that they did for the 2nd pressing. The second row is the usual European pressing on We Bite Records. The first copy is a test pressing on We Bite, with the regular black vinyl next to it. Notice that they used the same cover as the Caroline release, but with a different color scheme. Also, I dont think there was a colored vinyl pressing on We Bite, which is sort of strange since the first YOT LP on We Bite was done on yellow, and the GB Start Today LP on We Bite was on blue vinyl. The 3rd row is another European release on Funhouse Records. Im not totally sure why they did different Euro releases, but based on the Flex discography, it says Funhouse came out originally in 1988 and then We Bite later in 1992 I dont know the details of why they switched from Funhouse to We Bite.

The last row is the 1997 Revelation re-pressing of the WNITA LP, with new cover art. There are 100 on deep red, 112 on deep purple, and tons of black vinyl. I figured the picture wouldnt pick up the difference, but surprisingly the picture accurately shows the difference of red vs. purple vs. black. When you put the red and purple vinyl up to the light you can easily see the difference! Even though the Caroline and We Bite releases have the same cover art (albeit different colors), the back covers are different. Caroline on left, We Bite on right. While were looking at the back covers, check out the back of the Funhouse release. Kinda wack how they highlighted the Xs on everyones hand in yellow, haha.

These are shown in the first row in the photo above. 1st pressing on Schism had white labels, 2nd had red labels. The second row is a 12 release on We Bite Records in Europe.

Then I mostly heard a bunch of metallic hardcore released in the mid and late 90s, but just couldnt get into any of it it just didnt sound like my GB or Minor Threat CDs. Zach had started a band called Conscientious Objector and he was really into some of the metallic stuff Rev was doing on Crisis Records like Shai Hulud and Morning Again. I tried to get into that stuff, but it really just never connected with me. It was actually a couple of months before I gradually realized that the sound I loved on the GB and Minor Threat records actually did exist today. Somehow I found out that some cool records had just come out, so I got those The first modern (at the time) hardcore records I got were Ensign Direction Of Things To Come, and In My Eyes The Difference Between. To this day, I still absolutely love both of these records. Like I said above, its hard to believe that a band went straight from a cassette tape demo to a 13 song LP that would revive one of the most classic straightedge hardcore record labels of all time, Revelation Records. Released in 1998, it was also the only release of any revival band that had an arty cover like this. With original artwork by Pushead, this definitely set this release apart. Everyone else had the usual live photos or hand-drawn hoodie dudes (one other exception that popped into mind was Fastbreaks Fast Cars, Fast Women LP with the photos of classic cars).

I dont know how many pressings they did over the years, but then in ~2001 they did another press of 330 on orange vinyl. Heres the dark red vinyl held up to the light. You can also get a look at those 1980s looking multi-colored labels. In the late 90s and early 2000s, this record was kind of like the Gorilla Biscuits on purple or the Judge on green for us late 90s revival kids. Other than Floorpunch on gold, which eventually kind of became the Chung King of our era, this was basically the next most collectible record. There were only 104 copies of this record on red vinyl, and these were an absolute bitch to get no one wanted to let theirs go. Even in 1999, these were selling for $60-$90, and that was a lot for a record back then. GB on purple and Judge on green sold for about $100-$125 back then, so the fact that this record was pushing up against those classics really said something about how pumped people were on getting this on red vinyl. I recently saw a copy of this record sell on eBay for under $50, which really made me sad.

I got my copy on red vinyl in 1999-2000 from Felix of Lifes Halt. Heres the note he wrote me when he sent me the LP. He was selling a bunch of records via an auction on the Rev Board (not eBay). Back then we used to do auctions on messageboards by taking in offers via email, and then making one update per day with the highest bid amount and the bidders initials. There would be a specified end-date, so on the last day, you just checked the messageboard for the current status of the bid, emailed in the best bid you could do to top it, and crossed your fingers that no one else emailed in anything higher.

I wasnt buddies with anyone related to this band, so I dont know how serious or un-serious the Rev Can Suck It thing was Either it was totally tongue in cheek, or they were pissed at Rev for something. My gut tells me it was probably the latter, just because shortly thereafter there were a couple volatile situations with other Rev bands from the Boston area being pissed off at Revelation (Fastbreak and Right Brigade). The rest of the 1st pressing was 220 on clear, 500 total on white (120 used for Rev Can Suck It covers, so 380 with regular covers), and a bunch on black. The Rev discography says ???? for the number on black vinyl for the 1st pressing. I got my clear and white copies directly via pre-order from Revelation.

    "text": "hat actually goes to show that this really was a big release, because most Revelation colored vinyl was 200-300, and it almost never sold through immediately with pre-orders. Also, as a comparison, my No Warning post talked about how when the No Warning pre-orders went out in 2002, only 173 of the free Terror 7s that came with that pre-order got the stamped label because thats how many pre-order packages there had been. No Warning Ill Blood was most definitely a hugely hyped and anticipated release in 2002, and it had the luxury of coming out after 2001 when hardcore had a huge popularity explosion due to American Nightmare, etc. But still, there were only 173 pre-orders for it. So the 220 clear vinyl copies of In My Eyes selling out via pre-order is definitely notable. I never did own a 1st pressing on black vinyl. The 2nd press was on blue vinyl out of 330, and was sold on the European Tour later in 2000. I was lucky enough to get a European kid to buy me an extra copy in exchange for buying him some similar tour pressing here in California for another band. I used to do that a lot with East Coast and European kids, so I had a little network of them that would help me out. Unfortunately, that European Tour basically meant the end for In My Eyes, because their vocalist Pete quit on tour and flew home, with their roadies having to finish the vocal duty for the rest of the tour.

The 3rd pressing of Nothing To Hide didnt come until somewhat recently, maybe 2007-2009? It was a final pressing on black vinyl out of 150 copies. I dont think there is a way to tell the difference between the 1st pressing black or 3rd pressing black. I checked my 1st pressing clear copy vs. 3rd pressing black copy to see if theres anything with the LP jacket, labels, or vinyl matrix etching that could denote a difference, but I didnt really notice anything different. Heres the back of my Rev Can Suck It, #62/120. I, along with about a million hardcore kids, loved the layout for this release. It looked cool and clean, with lots of classic black and white photography. Every traditional hardcore band started wanting their layout to look like a mix of Nothing To Hide and insert whatever else here . Dont believe me? Just ask Scott Magrath, who did a ton of hardcore layouts for all sorts of bands during the 2000s era, and had to hear this all the time from kids like me, haha.

Everyone talked a ton of shit about this LP when it came out. It has this song Music Is My Girlfriend, its got a bubble-gum-boy-band type layout, and the dudes in the band started wearing tight black v-neck t-shirts, designer jeans, and touring with Saves The Day. Everyone gave them a hard time. Fuck it, I went and saw them on that Saves The Day tour and I had a good time. Despite this LP being poppy and a bit of a change in direction from their earlier stuff, I like it and Im fine with it. haha. The other bit of controversy about this record is that they broke up shortly after releasing it, but they had signed a two record deal with Revelation. This issue reared its ugly head a couple years later when Pat (vocalist of Fastbreak) was playing guitar in Right Brigade, and Revelation claimed that Right Brigade owed them a record since the Fastbreak contract stipulated that members future bands would owe towards the contract if Fastbreak did not fulfill both record deals. Right Brigade was already having band member problems internally, and there were all sorts of crazy rumors about the Right Brigade LP having all those crazy samples on it, and how the samples were added in late night recording sessions without Jesse Standard (vocalist) knowing about it until it was released. Then the rumor was that Right Brigade was pur",

All sorts of rumors like that. Bottom line is the band was on its last legs, and if an LP was going to come out, it was going to come out on Revelation due to Fastbreak contract issues. Who knows how it all actually played out. Despite all the controversy, I think the record is pretty cool, and Ill throw it on every once in a while. REV-86 Where Fear And Weapons Meet The Weapon LPAnother solid release from Where Fear And Weapons Meet, but didnt get a lot of press. This was a pretty good record check it out if youve never heard it. Orange vinyl out of 222. Back cover REV-91 Ignite Call On My Brothers LPThis album is actually kind of a classic at this point. Its fun to joke and make fun of the whole opera-core vibe, but it goes so far beyond a guilty pleasure Dont we all love this shit? I love you maaaaaan! This LP actually wasnt released on Revelation. It was released by Conversion Records, but since Rev re-released the CD-only version as REV-91, I figured Id include it here. I think that I remember hearing that there were 500 pressed on clear vinyl, but its not documented on the Rev site or anything. Back cover Revelation didnt release this one, but I didnt have another area for Ignite records. A Place Called Home was released by a bigger label. Reverse side REV-94 the Nerve Agents Days Of The ",

Back cover The third Nerve Agents LP was released by Hellcat Records, not Revelation, but I figured Id include it here anyway. I dont think they pressed it on colored vinyl at all? I never liked the cover artwork at all, I just didnt think it was very well done. Reverse side of the insert. I meant to flip the jacket over to show the back cover as well, whoops! REV-97 the Movielife This Time Next Year LPThis was a pretty good LP in the Saves The Day vein. It seems like a lot of these dudes have stuck around and done a bunch of other bands too (Crime In Stereo, yeah?). 750 on blue vinyl. I thought the layout was pretty cheesy and predictable with the little stars Back cover Revelation didnt release The Movielife Has A Gambling Problem 12, but I figured Id include it here with the other Movielife record. Im not usually a fan of picture disc type things, but this one looks pretty cool with the dice pressed in between the clear vinyl. Mine is #818/1000.

I dont know if any of this is true, but it was a pretty commonly held rumor. On top of it, the title of the record Steal This is supposedly meant to be literal: steal this, dont buy it from Revelation. Oh, hardcore. sigh. haha. Reverse side REV-100 V/A Revelation 100 2xLP CompilationFor years there was a gap in the Rev catalog because they wanted to release something special for Revelation #100. Finally this double-LP compilation of rarities came out, and it was pretty under-whelming. There were 300 on orange vinyl, 801 on black. I do remember thinking the Shai Hulud song was pretty cool. It had guest vocals from Aaron Bedard of Bane, and the song was much faster and shorter than the usual Shai Hulud stuff. Hopefully Im remembering that right. REV-101 Right Brigade s/t LPAh, the Right Brigade LP. The pressing info on this one is simple only one pressing, 317 on red vinyl, 775 on black vinyl. There were all sorts of funny rumors swirling about this record before it came out on Revelation Records. It all started with the Fastbreak Whenever Youre Ready LP that came out on Revelation.

Reverse side REV-122 Judge What It Meant The Complete Discography 2xLPIn 2005, Revelation released the Judge What It Meant discography on a 2xLP format. The entire first pressing was 2300 on this crazy multi colored splatter/split/etc vinyl. I think it looks really awful, and I wish they would have just stuck with more basic colors. I think they got caught up in the year 2000s craze of wild vinyl being pressed in Europe at GZ Media in the Czech Republic. I cant say much, because I definitely pressed some of the splatter or split vinyl when I was running Rivalry Records. Some of that stuff can be kinda neat for a limited run, but only when it makes a bit more sense with the layouts or something. This one was just way too much going on two different LPs, with two different half/half split vinyl colors, with splatter on top of that was just way overboard. All subsequent pressings are on black vinyl. I also owned a test pressing, shown further below.

Close-up of the C-side label (the A-side of the 2nd LP). REV-130 V/A Generations LP CompilationGenerations features songs representing some of the best bands from this era of hardcore. My buddy, Bob Shedd, put together this compilation when he was handling most of the label duties at Revelation Records. He did such a sweet job, all the way down to patterning the layout after the original NYHC: The Way It Is LP comp. Like any classic compilation should, it accurately documents a snapshot in time of a particular generation of hardcore kids. What you see here is a test pressing plus a blue vinyl copy. There was also red vinyl pressed. The red and blue vinyl are out of 550 each, the test pressing is out of 42. They had to make a bunch so each band member could have one. Cover and insert.

Normally Im not a fan of the crazy splatter vinyl thing, but the white splatter on top of the green and blue does resemble a lightning storm really well, so I dig it a lot. There were 179 of these pressed. Back cover 268 on blue vinyl with green splatter. REV-143 Sinking Ships Ten 7A pretty shoddy record release cover made by just writing on the covers with metallic gold ink for Sound And Fury Festival. Mine is #72.

Now that he mentions it, its obvious that the SOIA, NFAA, and SBS 1st pressing inserts all have the exact same paper that was used on the Project X 7 cool!

Thanks for doing this page. Cheers Guido Reply Kyle Whitlow says: September 19, 2011 at 4:32 PM Who knows. Having run a record label myself, heres my best guess: they printed like a billion covers say 15,000 to start. But they only did 5,000 pieces of vinyl and 5,000 color inserts. You get huge volume discounts on printing, so thats why you sometimes press more covers and/or inserts than you do vinyl. So They probably had way more 7 covers than they did inserts and/or vinyl, which is why you see that 1st pressing spelling mistake on later pressings that do not have a colored insert. But, I mean, I wasnt there physically pressing the records, nor receiving them into the Rev warehouse, so these sorts of things are always subject to guessing and interpretation. I really do think that anything with a black and white insert is a later pressing though. Or how about this maybe yours is a 1st pressing, but someone LOST the full color insert, and along the way someone threw a black and white insert into their first pressing cover so that it would at least have some sort of lyric sheet. That kind of shit happens ALL the time. All in all, record collecting is just for fun, and these sort of pressing abnormalities are just that fun abnormalities that are cool to document Who knows what really happened. Reply Jeff says: Se",

By the ‘90s, however, New York artists and fans were dealing with a crumbling scene infrastructure and a sinking economy, making it increasingly difficult for clubs to remain open and labels to stay solvent . Even so, the scene meant so much to so many that countless fans and bands continued the spirit of NYHC outside the city limits. Many of these groups were bred on New York’s rough and tumble pioneers and had a sense of hedonistic revelry to them; others were more attracted to the straight edge scene. The blending of cultures created a movement that was less nihilistic and more proactive than the original NYHC. Two of the figureheads were ex-Violent Children vocalist Ray Cappo and guitarist John Porcelly, who started the straight edge band Youth of Today in 1985. Two years later, in New Haven, Connecticut, Cappo and Justin Cooper founded Revelation Records with the intention of pressing only one release, New York band Warzone’s debut 7-inch, Lower East Side Crew. And yet, despite its founders’ original plans, Revelation Records’ discography exploded from there, with notable 7-inches from Sick Of It All and Gorilla Biscuits, as well as a reissue of Youth of Today’s debut EP Can’t Close My Eyes (originally released by Positive Force Records in 1985).

    "text": " 1988 compilation New York Hardcore: The Way it Is—featuring Warzone, Nausea, Gorilla Biscuits, Sick of it All, Youth of Today, and more—cemented Revelation’s status as NYHC’s most important label, a wheelhouse that soon expanded to accommodate the emergent straight edge and post-hardcore scenes, and even a few experimental bands. During this time, Cappo and Porcelly discovered the International Society for Krishna Consciousness and became Hare Krishnas; in 1991, they formed the “Krishnacore” band Shelter, giving rise to a whole new subgenre. When Cappo left Revelation shortly thereafter to launch his own label, Equal Vision Records, Cooper moved the label to California and forged ever onwards, with releases from straight edge bands (Bold, In My Eyes) alternative outfits (Shades Apart, Into Another), pop-punk groups (CIV, The Movielife), emo ensembles (Sense Field, Elliott) and metallic hardcore crushers (Judge, Primal Rite). 32 years in, Revelation Records’ broad catalog has something for everyone, provided they like it loud.

Originally, the Maryland-based outfit planned to record a few songs just for kicks, but over the course of that brief studio stint, the trio discovered a potent creative chemistry that would form the basis of something far more durable. On their full-length debut, Just One, Better Than a Thousand sound just as furious as Youth of Today, albeit slightly less didactic; standouts like “Motivation” and “Nightclub” play out as upbeat, melodic happycore songs, as opposed to pit-starting hardcore tirades.

Released in 1998, U.S. Songs, Elliott’s first full-length, is the band’s most confessional and agonized, revealing heartbreak, ennui, and disenfranchisement through painfully personal songs that express as much through the aching instrumentation as they do through the lyrics. While album opener “Miracle” layers guitar and emo vocal angst like a cross between early Afghan Whigs and Buffalo Tom, “Second Story Skyscraper” is more outwardly elegiac, layering languorous guitar lines over pained vocals and building the tension with more turbulent, though still melodic passages, before ",

Many fans consider Elliott’s 2000 release False Cathedrals to be their best, and while the release includes strong, despairing material, the way Elliott downplays guitar aggression in favor of louder vocals and softer, more accessible pop-inflected songs on that album makes U.S. Songs more appealing to fans of hardcore and metal.

Inside Out released just one seven-inch, 1990’s No Spiritual Surrender, which was expanded into a six-song CD before the group disbanded. Interestingly, Inside Out planned to title its first full-length, Rage Against the Machine, but they never made it that far, since guitarist Vic DiCara quit and became a Hare Krishna.

The resulting sound is difficult to pinpoint and impossible to ignore, making the title of their second album Ignaurus (“ignore us”—get it?) as ironic as it was original. From the spiritual, acoustic strains of “Two Snowflakes” and “Anxious” to the psychedelic guitar spirals, incendiary, off-kilter rhythms, and paranoiac vocals of “Poison Fingers,” Into Another pushed boundaries and raised social awareness not through brute force, but empathy and innovation.

As a frontman, Barbieri nails it on the first try, shouting along with an unrepentant barrage of buzzing guitars leavened with slower chugs and melodic gang vocals. “Crazy But Not Insane” and “As One,” which barrels along to the chorus, “We will be united / AS ONE,” are most representative of the bands’ tough-yet-accessible songs.

Perhaps YOT’s greatest album, Break Down the Walls, ironically, went more or less unnoticed in 1986 when it was first released on Wishingwell Records. However, when Revelation reissued it in 1988, it took off. The album, which skews far more frantic than the band’s mini-album Can’t Close My Eyes, makes for a raging, primitive listen, comprised of one-and-two-minute long songs that showcase the band’s simple, steely devotion to straight edge ideology.

Formerly of New Haven, Connecticut, it is now based in Huntington Beach, California. It was founded in 1987 by owner Jordan Cooper, along with Ray Cappo of Youth of Today, with the sole intent of producing the Warzone Lower East Side Crew 7. Within the year, they put out two more releases and a limited 4th pressing of Youth of Todays Cant Close My Eyes 7, which had been originally released on Positive Force Records, just for the two of them to trade for vintage G.I.Joes and other action figures. In the first three years, the label put out 23 releases and pressed approximately 50,000 records, and it has continued to release an average of 7-8 albums a year. Cappo left the business in 1988, to focus on his band Shelter. He also started his own label Equal Vision Records (which he later sold to Youth of Today roadie, former Revelation employee and friend, Steve Reddy), though his albums were still released by Revelation after that, and he also operated Supersoul Records. The label put out several definitive hardcore and metalcore records in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with n",

    "text": "ns, and allow Jordan to inform us. More to come... -DCXXWarzone seven inch: here is where it all kicked off. Could you tell us a good Raybeez story involving this record? I am sure he had some hand in it, and I am sure it is somehow funny. Also, for the first Revelation release, what do you think of this record?Raybeez was one of the most gracious and friendly people I ever dealt with believe it or not. When Cappo interviewed me for the “Talk About Unity” documentary (coming...soon...not too soon, but soon) he asked me to talk about Raybeez and I said something like “he was a really nice guy,” then Cappo cut me off saying something like “you can’t just say he was a nice guy! Describe him! He was a big skinhead with tattoos. Paint the picture for people.” He must have seemed like a scary guy to some people, but at that point, I considered the punks and hardcore people my friends regardless of what they looked like. Obviously he had a reputation and was a skinhead but I never saw anything that correlated with either of those stories or stereotypes personally so I accepted him as he presented himself to me...a decent guy. Really, the only funny things about Ray that I experienced are the things that everyone already knows about him. His handwriting was grafitti influenced and he always put quotation marks in all four corners.NFAA seven inch: the first west coast Revelation release.

    "text": "n at the time as a label that was just bigger than the NY/CT ties it previously held? Whose doing was the release?Ray and Porcell were friends with Dan from touring and that’s how that happened. It was only a big deal in the sense that it was the first band from outside the area we were going to work with. But it wasn’t that much of a big deal, people seemed happy about it and then we started getting demos from other bands in CA too.NYC Hardcore The Way It Is LP: to this day, if you had to pick a song off of that comp to represent that time and the record most appropriately, what would you pick? Why? Is there a song on there that still means as much to you 20 years later as it did when you heard it for the first time?I’m better with the technical details than opinions, but this is pretty much impossible for me to answer. I had such a great time working on that record that pretty much everything on there meant something to me. The songs that Warzone and Bold and all the other bands I already knew were great. Talking to Neil from Nausea, Jason and Damon from Krakdown, Jeff from Breakdown and everyone else was really good and it felt like a record that everyone was going to like. I guess “As One” and “Together” were sort of theme songs for that comp because they definitely captured the spirit of it.BOLD seven inch: to this day, many people can’t get over how much this band “changed” from “Speak Out” the previous year, to this release.

    "text": " photo, acid wash jean jacket, backwards sound byte. Do you remember thinking “Man, I guess Matt Bold has grown up?”It’s hard to believe that was only one year later, but there also must have been at least a year between the time Bold recorded Speak Out to when it finally came out, so maybe the actual musical transition wasn’t so abrupt. Yeah...the photo. They got more shit from their friends for that than from anyone else. I thought it was a little over the top, but it wasn’t too long before that record came out that our record layouts were done with photocopies and scotch tape so just having good production values on a record layout that I put together myself (under the band’s direction) was probably all I was worrying about. I think that was the first record that we did that Dave Bett didn’t design that went through normal (or close to normal) record sleeve printing production. Everything before that was done locally and had folded paper in plastic bag covers except for the first two thousand Sick Of It All records which were printed locally and then hand cut and glued into record jackets by me mostly and a couple of my friends.Quicksand seven inch: in your eyes, did this band have future rock stardom written all over it with this release?

    "text": " to argue with Walter about it because I didn’t want to see him using a grammatically “incorrect” word. He didn’t seem to care, but I’d basically argue that you can’t turn a noun into an adjective by adding “able” to the end if that noun has a verb form. In other words, the “correct” way to say that, would be to use “excretable.” A similar example using a different Quicksand word is “omission.” If you wanted to say something could be done without, you would say “omittable,” not “omissionable.” From what I remembered he thought it was amusing that I cared about it, but he just liked the way it was.

Book By Carlos Ramirez | @noechonet | 12.7.2017 Courtesy of Revelation Records Just in time for the holiday season, Revelation Records is dropping Life. Love. Shirts: A Collection of Hardcore Clothing, a new book centered around the mind-blowing t-shirt collection of Orhun &Ouml;ner, a German hardcore aficionado who many No Echo readers will know from his popular Instagram page. In addition to photos of Orhuns extensive collection, many of the pages feature stories from the bands, labels, and those who had a hand in the shirt in question. Courtesy of Revelation Records \"Orhun s Instagram page was the first I d heard about him,\" says Revelation Records owner Jordan Cooper when I ask him how Orhun and his t-shirt collection first arrived on his radar. \"Later, we ordered the first version of his book, which I think he referred to as a zine, to carry on the RevHQ.com store.\" You can blame the international shipping gods, but if youve ordered stuff from overseas, youll painfully relate to Jordan here: \"Unfortunately, when the box he sent us arrived, it was torn open and completely empty.

I was pretty flattered when I got the email from Jordan.\" Courtesy of Revelation Records Record collecting is one thing, but t-shirts? I guess Jordan isnt as surprised. \"At this point, shirt collecting has been a big thing for a while. I remember being surprised back in the 90s or early 00s when the prices started getting out of hand.

Before I let him go, I ask him what he found to be the hardest aspects of putting Life. Love. Shirts. together. \"To be honest, there were no tough parts about putting this together. I enjoyed every minute of it, working with my friends Ryan Kuper, Marc Linkenheil [the books photographer], Chris Holt [who handled the layout], Jordan, Revelation Records, and the heroes of my youth. It was big fun! We are pretty proud of the book.\" Sadly, since working on the book with Orhun, Ryan passed away after a long battle with cancer. \"Ryan was one of the greatest dudes I knew. He did so many things just because he cared so much about the core and love for the music. It breaks my heart that he won t see the books release and all the feedback from it.

Was it weird to think that one year the Inside Out seven inch was just a popular semi-recent hardcore record and the next year the front man was front page music news? Did you expect it? Had you missed any opportunity to work with Rage on the first record? How did it work out to do the vinyl for People Of The Sun years later?It was amazing how quickly Rage took off. At the time it seemed fast, but looking back, it was, like you say, pretty much the next year. I remember seeing them play in someone's living room the year I moved here and from that day on people couldn't stop talking about them. It was really weird seeing Zack doing those songs. They were so different than what he'd done before that I didn't know what to think other than \"holy shit.\" I don't think working with them was an option. Their cassette demo, which they just handed out to people, probably got into as many hands as any record we'd ever put out at the time, so they pretty much needed a bigger label than Rev right away. Zack's always been busy, but helped o",

Zack carries enough weight that only a couple of calls from him to the label overcame any hesitation that they had during the process.One of the few people to have some type of contact with Mike Judge over the years has been you. Probably a topic nobody gets tired of talking about is his mystique...what have you learned about him over the years and what usually puts you in touch with him? There have to be at least some good tidbits.It's funny how that happens. I think a lot of that is just due to the fact that he's busy and doesn't have a lot of contact with people who are still involved in hardcore (the way Walter or Porcell do). I've never gotten to know him that well. Porcell and Mark Ryan knew him really well obviously. I just talk to him when the need arises for artwork, royalties etc. He's always been cool, happy to talk about stuff. I think I've gotten to know him more now than when Judge was active, but still, that's not all that well. I know he still writes and records music (at least the last time I talked to him). Someone ran into him last year and posted a photo to the Livewire board I think. If you want to get stories about him, might as well just interview him. He'd probably be happy to answer some questions if he has time. (ED. NOTE: If you only knew how we've tried...)Mike Judge regulates ",

    "text": "the massive crowd at City Gardens, Trenton NJ, Photo: Ken SalernoYou seem to have a lot of fond memories for the early CT HC scene you grew up in, including a lot of lesser known bands that were a part of it. Have you ever thought about releasing any material by some of those bands on Revelation, and if so, why haven't you?I talked a little bit to Todd Knapp when he was thinking about different ways to reissue all of the 76 stuff. I loved all of the CT bands, but those guys were putting out their own records when I was still going to the New Haven Coliseum to see bands like Van Halen. There was always a pretty tight knit CT scene around the Anthrax and the early 80's hardcore/punk bands that were the regulars there. I've never really felt like there was a need to get involved with releasing their music since there always seems to be a label that's run by one of their close friends that's there to put their records out. Revelation started out from Ray Cappo's friends' bands, so that was sort of a different scene. If it made sense to put out anything specific, then it probably would have happened. I wanted to put out a Violent Children record, but a couple of those guys don't want their stuff in print. There was a CT band called Entombed (not the death metal one that came later) that I was talking about releasing with Jim Martin.You traveled with YOT and GB to Europe in 1989 for their tours.

    "text": "T and GB tours from '89 were great. The insular feeling of being in a small group was kind of weird, but also led to a lot of laughs. Ray was really going full steam into the Hare Krishna religion so it was hard to get him to talk about anything else. The memorable experiences of the YOT tour was meeting a lot of people who had a very different view of the world than I did. The only really dreadful thing that I remember was one squat that the bands played at had a bacterial infection going around that, if you had a cut on your hand and got it, would cause your hand to swell up like a football.Cappo circa early Shelter with Graham and Carl The Mosher, Photo: Ken SalernoEveryone loves a Sloth Crew story. You seemed to be a part of their scene when you moved Rev out to California - what type of mayhem did you get into, or avoid, with those guys when you got to California?Wait for the movie. Hopefully Jim Brown will do it someday. I think most of those guys were out of college by the time I moved out here so the Sloth Crew and \"Nyhus Guys\" were all just one group of friends (and still are). I had a great time when I came out to visit and that's one of the main reasons I moved out here. It's funny, but I can't think of any specific stories. I've heard them told so many times I just know them by the shorthand and I wasn't even there for most of them. In a nutshell, if it could be snuck into, out of, taken or destroyed, they did it.

They had lots of line-up changes but the two persons constantly playing in the band were the two brothers Dominiek and Frederik. They started out as an Old-School sounding hardcore band and evolved to more groovier Hardcore while not loosing that flavour. Dominiek and Frederik were the youngest musicians in the scene back then.VitalityVitality is a H8000 Hardcore band formed in the midst of the nineties. They were from the coastal area of West-Flanders, Belgium. They produced a compact disc called Bloodline for Sober Mind and Good Life Recordings. Their second album called Crucial Wires was released on a French label. Their musical delivery is catchy and heavy New School Hardcore. Besides being recognised by the older H8000 Godfathers they had their own scene, called the ODK Posse. ODK is short for Oostduinkerke. Oostduinkerke is a coastal village were they gathered to skateboard and to rehears for their band. There you can still find the Oodeekay skateshop as well. Also created by people from this scene are the iconic cover for the Blackened Persistance LP, the band ODK Crew and finally the band Forced Hate.Wheel Of ProgressWheel Of Progress was the band before Liar, they played a prototypical Edge-Metal sound.

Interview by Jeff Lasich. Live pictures By Jeff the rest are property of Revelation Records. On the Chung King “where are they” page, it says that about 20 are still in the vault. Why did you keep that many, and are you planning on doing something with them (besides having a raffle at Hellfest) We dont have 20 anymore, but we do have a few. Theyve been given to people who work/worked here, sold on the charity auction etc. No different plans for the rest really. The band and Rev split up the ones that werent sent to people who preordered Bringin It Down. The discography page also says there are around 200 Chain silver sleeves in the vault as well. Yeah, we still have most of those, but again, they trickle out here and there. GB The vault is rumored to contain mint Project X 7”s with the zine, YOT 7”s on gold, Chung King’s, Warzone records, the Arc of the Covenant, Jimmy Hoffa, and Atlantis.

    "text": " pressing and one of every color vinyl record. The old stuff is just a few of the first pressings of most of the early stuff, a box of later pressings here and there (eg Warzone clear, Chain clear, the last pressings of SBS and NFAA 7s from the 80s). We do have one or two of the schism w/PX and some of the original Rev7 lyric books. A few YOT orange, a couple of Judge and Wide Awake 7s from Skiz. There has been the rumor of a 7” box set for years now. Will this ever see the light of day? What will be in it? (If it won’t come out, what was going to be in it?) Ok, I like these questions. This is the type of minutia that I think about and remember so I can answer this. Weve talked about doing something useful with the records in the closet (aka the vault) for a while and I have wanted to do a limited box set for them for years. The problem that weve always had is that there are different numbers of each record and one of the records (Sick Of It All I think) we have less of than any of the others so that would limit how many complete ones we could make. Then we have the issue of completeness itself, which means different things depending on how anal a collector one is. To me, having one of each record regardless of pressing, color etc is fine. To some other people its having all first press or all color or whatever. Then there are the people who want one of every pressing. Since there was no way to satisfy any of those with what we have I always thought this would be the best pla",

    "text": "n: Make 100 boxes with one each of Revs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 10 (mixed pressings). Wed also sell the boxes with random single copies of those records for people who just want the box to either put the records they have in or for whatever else. We also want to put a decent booklet in there, which at this point Id say is the thing that is holding the project up. It seems like a crazy thing to even worry about maybe, but thats one thing I really want to do for some reason. BOLD Rev has started a run of “final presses” on a lot of vinyl. Is that really going to be the last time people will be able to get those records on vinyl? Thats what were saying. Hopefully we wouldnt go back on that, but I also wouldnt be terribly sad if vinyl sales came back enough for us to consider it. Have you ever given thought to doing a “final press” of the Chain 7”? Not really since its on the LP now. Re-pressing the out of print stuff is something I dont really want to get into. If the music is available, then thats what I care about. The only tracks that Im aware of that you cant get anymore are the entire Warzone 7, the Side By Side song on Rev2 (but thats getting added to the SBS discography when we fix that up), the version of Bolds Talk Is Cheap on Rev2, but thats going on the Bold discography and the versions of Together by Youth of Today and Searching for the Light by Supertouch were different on the Way It Is comp from the versions on Rev2.

    "text": "t on a Youth Of Today discography at some point. Raybeez didnt want their 7 in print so thats why they re-recorded those tracks for Lower East Side that Victory put out. That about covers everything. COS Another rumor was that Rev was going to do a re-press of the Reason to Believe lp. I think Jason Upright told me that in 96 or 97. Obviously, that hasn’t happened yet. Should I keep my hopes up? We thought about doing that and talked to them, but they were never all that worried about it and we didnt push hard to get it done so it just never happened. Several other people have asked me for their number to try to get it done so hopefully someone will actually put it out soon. The funny thing is that you can still find copies of the cd pretty easily so I think more people want to put it out because they love the band than because its something that a ton of people cant find. Do you feel weird knowing that people (myself included) obsess over getting every version of Revelation records? Sometimes I feel bad about it. Obsessive record collecting is hard to understand, but a lot of people I respect and consider friends do it so I try not to look down on it. Sometimes people who do it sound like they hate the fact that they need every pressing. For a lot of labels and records completeness is a moving target depending on how you define it and what happens re-press wise. I feel a lot less guilt now knowing that we dont press that many records anymore and that we dont make much on eac",

    "text": "h one. JUDGE If the Chung King record was pressed pretty much for people who had pre-ordered, and wasn’t going to be for sale, as the band re-recorded and left off 2 tracks, why did MRR get a copy? It’s funny; in the review they mention how it was going to drive collectors crazy. Who knows? I looked up to Tim and considered him a friend though I only saw him once in a while. Maybe I just wanted to show people that SOMETHING was happening about the Judge LP. A lot of people prefer the Chung King recording to the Bringing It Down one, me included. On the Judge discography that will be coming out later this year both records will be there so people will get to have it even if their obsessive collecting side isnt sated. Do you have a test press for every Rev record? It is possible that Im missing one, but I doubt it. We have two complete sets as far as I know, plus Kevin Finn, the Rev archiver, has everything as well. Tell me about the beginnings of Revelation. We should put out a Warzone record That would be rad Ok, lets do it Ray talked to them and basically made it happen. Oh wait, that wasnt a question. Ok Ill answer those below now. So you and Cappo decided to start a label and put out the Warzone demo as a 7”. In 1987, was it common for someone to take a chance and put out a record? I’m sure it was a lot harder then, as resources weren’t as abundant as they are today. Yeah, thats basically the story. It was pretty common for bands to put out their own records and people to ",

    "text": "start labels. It seemed less common then, but there were tons of records and thousands of labels around. Rays band Violent Children put out their record so Ray wasnt held back at all. Kinkos and later Macs made doing layouts and printing a lot easier. Porcell With BOLD Singing Nailed To The X. What made you leave Connecticut for California? I was ready for a change and I hated the heat and humidity of east coast summers and heard CA was better. Porcell took me and a few of his friends out for a visit to his west coast friends and I decided to move later that year. Do you think it’s crazy that kids still go nuts for bands like GB, YOT, Judge, Chain, etc? People get inspired by different things. I try to keep an open mind, but its easy to be jaded after all this time. JUDGE After the first pressing of the GB 7”, it needed to be remixed (?) What is the story behind that? There was a lot of time that passed between the original pressing and when we had to do that. Basically the pressing plant that did that record went out of business so we lost the master, plates and whatever print was there. The record had to be remixed just so we could get it remastered, and press more. There was nothing wrong with the first pressings mix, but I think the guys who were in the band prefer the second one, though Im not 100% positive on that memory. Has there ever been a band you really wanted to work with, but it never happened? Sense Field was almost that band. I was never more into a band than ",

I waited but no reply so I went to a few shows and finally talked to them and finally convinced them that they didnt have to be hardcore to be on Rev. I cant think of a lot of bands that I really loved that we missed out on though Im sure there are plenty of great bands we missed. New Found Glory asked us to put out their record before they went to Drive Thru. I still have a Good Riddance demo somewhere that probably never got listened to until way after they were on Fat Wreck. YOT Really, who the hell was Slipknot? Where did they come from? I had never heard of them, and then all of a sudden, the best label in the world put out their 7”. They were some kids from New Haven that I kind of knew. They were crazy. I used to play guitar with Mike (the drummer), but I think they only reason he did was so he and F (the guitar player) could use my amp for Slipknot (who went by Evil Dead at first). One time I came by and they had one amps out going into the input of another amp and I was like what are you doing, this is going to mess something up. They just said, we like the way it sounds so I figured they were just on a different level than I was operating on and after that, but not for that reason, I stopped hanging out with them.

Our friend Brian helped get them together and to the studio and they did that record and after it came out they did one show at CBs. That was about it. Long before the record was recorded they had done some shows in CT. The singer was in Fatal Vision before Slipknot with John Nutcher who works at Revelation now. Thats as much as I can tell you about Slipknot. YOT What about all the mail order problems back in the day? Slow but get it there was our motto I guess. Im about the slowest person anyone could know so the stuff just was always ahead of me. I always wanted to make shirts of that famous office cartoon that said You want it when and had all these people rolling on the floor laughing. No one thought that would be a good idea though. Now that other people handle the mail order, speed is no longer the issue it once was. Have you ever thought about using some of the older Rev shirt designs? Really, it’s time for a new Chain shirt! Yeah, weve been talking about that for years. Ill see what I can do. Thanks for reminding me. GB Where do you in the future for Rev?

New Arrivals Clear View all results Collabs Culture DATE-2017-July Essays Interviews Music Skate The Sound & the Fury :: A Brief History of Revelation RecordsBy Anthony Pappalardo Jul 16, 2017 The greatest labels in music history are the ones that tell a story and suck you into their catalog. Blue Note, Motown, Stax, Rough Trade, Factory, Dangerhouse, Touch and Go, Def Jam, Dischord, Sub Pop, Amphetamine Reptile, Death Row, No Limit, and others are more than just businesses that pressed vinyl records, cassettes, and compact discs. Each of those labels provided a voice to a place and time that not only resonates today, but explains a part of the history of culture. They also all share the bond of starting independently, creating their own playbook out of growth, necessity, and aspiration. Though they all bear deep catalogs, you can extract a “sound” or even “sounds” from each, and that story has more currency than any major label.Founded in 1987 in New Haven, Connecticut, Revelation Records was able to spread the narrative of the neighboring hardcore punk bands in New York City, but not through an urban lens. With much of NYC still in economic turmoil, independent labels in, especially thoughts tangential to punk were hardly sustainable or able to fully support a roster of bands. Fledgling singles were released, as were compilations, but the lifespan of most labels was just a few years. ",

Without a single label truly representing the region, Revelation Records quickly became the most important New York City vinyl producer for hardcore, while being based in Connecticut. At a time when New York was still recovering from economic strife, where the scene was lacking any order other than its unifying sense of camaraderie and passion, it made perfect sense that New Haven was a more stable setup for a start up.Most importantly, Cappo and Cooper were fans—high school friends who bonded over an interest in punk rock—that had a golden opportunity to put their stamp on it. “Ray got transferred into my English class a few weeks after school started,” Cooper explains. “He was a different kind of person than most of the people I knew at the time. He didn’t fit into any particular clique, but wasn’t going down the disaffected path that a lot of us took in school. He was in various clubs, maybe on team or two, was in a band and didn’t see",

Photo: noecho.netCappo was already active, having played in several bands including Violent Children, Reflex from Pain, and Youth of Today. This allowed Cooper to assume the role of operations and production, while Cappo was the charismatic personality who secured the talent. OK, that’s an overly sexy description, but it was very much the dynamic. With their first release lined up, the next challenge was figuring out where to press the actual records and how to distribute them, other than at shows, which was especially challenging, since their first release was a 7” from a band that was allegedly breaking up. There was no defined model or pipeline other than taking out ads in fanzines and asking shops to take records on consignment, only to end up having to chase money. Distributors? Huh?Luckily, the demand for the Warzone EP was so high that it set off a string of releases that symbolized a new era in East Coast hardcore. The singles were as coveted as those that came before them, and became cared for pieces that were as aesthetically interesting as they were sounding, without ever teetering into artsy.Ray Cappo performing live in YOT circa late-’80s.“As far as I remember it, Warzone was talking about breaking up, and we thought it was something that should be documented,” Cooper says of Rev",

It seemed like most of the other hardcore labels around got their records done through Kane Boychuck who worked at a pressing plant in Los Angeles. We met Kane when Youth Of Today toured with 7 Seconds in 1985 because he did the pressing for Positive Force—Kevin Seconds’ label—which included the first Youth Of Today record. When Revelation needed records pressed a couple of years later, Ray reached out to Kane and that’s how the first couple of releases were pressed. As far as artwork goes, I worked at the school newspaper and had access to the typesetting machine so Raybeez and I worked on the layout by phone and mail mostly.”While the “sound” of early Revelation Records is more united by the ethos of the bands than the actual chords, the overarching message was what was so magnetic to city and ‘burb areas alike. Bands such as Youth of Today, Sick of It All, Gorilla Biscuits, Judge, Side by Side, and Warzone were not just inspired by the first wave of American hardcore, they tapped back into that energy with their own unique imprint and voice, rather than letting that spirit and verve fizzle out.

Conversely, Revelation’s early acts weren’t about excess, but rather a lean model of (mostly) straight edge leaning bands, bent on message over madness. Initially, the singles and 12”s were predominantly sold via mail order, with the majority of the early adopters being rewarded with limited colored vinyl pressings of said release. Not only did the records sound urgent, but their simple, bold layouts were equally direct and powerful. In a stroke of accidental marketing, most releases were accompanied with order forms for other releases as well as T-shirts, stickers, and sweatshirts.

I always loved the Rat Music comps because I heard bands that I didn’t know about and might not have ever listened to otherwise. For my part, helping put the compilations together was good experience for getting material from people and trying to organize everything and get it released. It’s a lot more involved than doing a record for one band, so you learn a lot more because you’re doing more.”A label “sampler,” especially for a punk label, is key—not only because it’s a lower production cost and functioned as a commercial for the entire catalog, but it’s an affordable entry point for a fan.

With matinees happening regularly both in New York as well as in Norwalk, CT at The Anthrax club, Revelation’s presence grew, especially as touring bands frequented the East Coast and vice versa.

And since Wishingwell kinda spun out of control after the release of Break Down the Walls, it left Rev as the only label on the block. They cribbed some notes from the WW marketing scheme by making T-shirts and making that a big part of their package. They really were selling a lifestyle in a way. Wear the shirt! Listen to the records! Belong!”As the decade turned, several of Revelation’s artists started to see their runs winding down. Three years in hardcore was typical, five years was epic, and anything more was almost longer than the genre itself, so you break up or form something new. For some of Rev’s original bands, new translated into actual innovation, creating new genres and factions, loosely lumped into “post-hardcore.” For the label, it was also a transitional time, as Cappo had broken up Youth of Today for seemingly the last time to pursue his Hare Krishna faith, later forming Shelter and Equal Vision Records as vehicle for the message.

Most importantly, the new setting and Cappo’s departure became a catalyst for one of Revelation’s most successful periods.“Not too long after Ray left the label, it did start to branch out to people and bands that were outside the initial circle,” Cooper says. “I just personally wanted a change in my life, and leaving New Haven seemed to be what I needed. I visited Huntington Beach, CA, with Porcell and a few of his friends and had a great time. A few months later, I decided to move here. Revelation had been in a few different locations while in New Haven but there was usually an ‘office’ and a ‘warehouse’ even if the office was a bedroom and the warehouse was a living room or basement or attic. In Huntington Beach, that setup continued and the first place Rev was located was a house that had a garage, so that served as the warehouse for the first year.”Inserts from Rev’s second release, a 7″ compilation called “Together.” Photo: seekingthesimple.wordpress.comFlyer for a Judge show from August 27, 1989.

It also almost never happened.“We were working on the 7” and Duane from Some Records and Dylan (Walter from Gorilla Biscuits’ brother) decided that they wanted to start a label and thought they should put out the GB 7”, he says. “Dylan called me and asked if I minded if they put it out instead of us and I said, ‘Sure, no problem.’” Once Ray heard about that, he was incredulous and called Walter and made sure we were going to do the record.”Shelter, Quicksand, Inside Out, Judge, Supertouch, Burn, Into Another, and Farside were shared a lineage, but were exploring diverse territory, each carving out new spaces.

To be more nuanced, they created a subgenre that would prove to be fertile ground for Lifetime, the Bouncing Souls, and later Saves the Day, ultimately becoming the new identity of pop punk. Starting on Rev’s sister label Crisis, being on Rev proper meant that fans would hear their LP, if not for any reason but to judge it, something that no hardcore label done before. Rochambeau quietly united coasts and scenes. Quicksand mixed the tight, battery of Helmet with hip-hop cadence, shoegaze, and early Seattle grunge; Into Another became the best unsigned progressive metal band in the world; while Shelter continued to charismatically convince kids to consider becoming Hare Krishnas to a Fugazi-esque tenor; simultaneously, Burn, Supertouch, and Inside Out bent the edges of traditional hardcore, while keeping its skeleton intact.“Much like Dischord, they ‘grew’ with their audience, and when the ‘90s hit, they were releasing bands that contained members of the previous bands that were on the label, but they were not playing tunes to mosh around your bedroom to anymore,” Rettman says. “Into Another and Texas Is The Reason seemed like the logical sonic next step for many... just not me.”Revelation achieved acclaim by being present and supporting the ideas of their network.

In the 2000s, when hardcore suddenly became “OK” for labels too “mature” to release it initially, Revelation was still sticking to their playbook, releasing new bands (hardcore and non-), as well as keeping old titles in print, curating expansive reissues, while maintaining a massive distribution network for outside labels, albeit with a small respite from pressing vinyl. 30 years later, they’re still putting out vital music, but more importantly, they’re maintaining a legacy that’s ripe to be discovered by new audiences ready to get tangled in their family tree.Gorilla Biscuits stage mayhem from @revxfest by @shcotta #gorillabiscuits #revfest #revelationrecords #revhqA post shared by Revelation Records (@revelationrecords) on Jul 6, 2017 at 7:34am PDT",

The label&#x27;s debut release was the 7-inch EP Lower East Side Crew by Warzone, which captured the raw energy of the era&#x27;s straight edge and youth crew movements. Cappo, a key figure in the band Youth of Today, departed the label in 1988 to pursue his own musical projects, including Shelter, leaving Cooper to steer its direction. Over its history, Revelation Records has amassed numerous releases, focusing on hardcore punk, metallic hardcore, post-hardcore, and indie rock, while maintaining a strong emphasis on limited-edition vinyl pressings that have cultivated a dedicated collector community. Notable early catalog highlights include seminal albums and EPs from bands like Youth of Today, Judge, and 108, which helped define the straight edge subculture and New York hardcore&#x27;s aggressive ethos. In the 1990s, the label expanded its roster to include diverse acts such as Texas Is the Reason and Lifetime, bridging 1980s hardcore roots with emerging emo and post-hardcore sounds, while also reissuing classic material to preserve punk histor",

Revelation&#x27;s enduring influence lies in its commitment to DIY principles, ethical punk values, and high-quality production, making it a cornerstone of the global hardcore community for nearly four decades. Background Founding and Principals Revelation Records was founded in 1987 by Jordan Cooper and Ray Cappo in New Haven, Connecticut, as an independent record label aimed at supporting the emerging New York hardcore (NYHC) scene. The founders, driven by a commitment to preserve and amplify the raw energy of local hardcore punk acts, established the label amid a burgeoning underground movement centered in nearby New York City. This DIY initiative reflected the era&#x27;s grassroots spirit, where enthusiasts took direct action to document and distribute music that major labels overlooked. The label&#x27;s inaugural release, Warzone&#x27;s Lower East Side Crew 7-inch EP (cataloged as REV 001), encapsulated its founding motivation: providing affordable, high-quality punk records tailored to the scene&#x27;s needs. Pressed in a limited initial run of approximately 1,000 copies, the EP captured the gritty ethos of NYHC and quickly became a cornerstone for the genre&#x27;s visibility.

Cooper, who has maintained ownership and leadership into 2025, guided the label through its evolution while upholding its independent roots. By the early 1990s, Revelation Records relocated to Huntington Beach, California, to streamline operations and tap into the West Coast&#x27;s growing punk infrastructure. The label&#x27;s business model centered on a DIY ethos, featuring modest press runs of around 1,000 copies for early releases and self-distribution through mail-order catalogs and direct sales at shows, fostering a direct connection with fans and artists. This approach emphasized accessibility and community support over commercial scale. Genre and Location Revelation Records has primarily focused on hardcore punk, with a strong emphasis on subgenres such as youth crew and New York hardcore (NYHC) in its early years, alongside post-hardcore, metalcore, and emo. The label&#x27;s initial straight-edge orientation stemmed from its founders&#x27; involvement in the movement, including Ray Cappo&#x27;s role in Youth of Today, which promoted positive, message-driven lyrics about sobriety and personal responsibility. The label played a pivotal role in popularizing youth crew hardcore, a variant characterized by upbeat, anthemic songs with pro-social themes that contrasted with the more nihilistic or aggressive strains of traditional punk and hardcore.

Originally founded in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1987, the label&#x27;s proximity to New York City allowed it to tap into the vibrant NYHC ecosystem, including access to iconic venues like CBGB, fostering connections with local bands and the straight-edge community. In the early 1990s, operations relocated to Huntington Beach, California, which broadened the label&#x27;s scope toward West Coast influences, including metalcore elements, and facilitated wider distribution through the RevHQ online store. While deeply tied to straight-edge ideals through its foundational releases, Revelation diversified in the 1990s by signing non-straight-edge acts, such as Lifetime, incorporating emo and melodic post-hardcore sounds that expanded its roster beyond sobriety-focused themes. As of 2025, the label remains based in Huntington Beach, California, achieving global reach via digital platforms like Bandcamp and Spotify, alongside ongoing vinyl reissues of its catalog to engage international fans and preserve hardcore&#x27;s legacy. History Early Years (1987–1999) Revelation Records experienced rapid growth in its formative years, releasing 23 records between 1987 and 1990 and pressing approximately 50,000 units in total during that period.

This release, along with Gorilla Biscuits&#x27; Start Today in 1989, helped solidify the label&#x27;s role in documenting the late-1980s punk revival, where bands drew from personal empowerment and community solidarity amid urban decay. The label&#x27;s involvement in the NYHC movement extended to supporting enduring acts like Sick of It All, whose 1989 album Blood, Sweat and No Tears exemplified the raw aggression and resilience of the scene, blending fast-paced riffs with lyrics addressing social frustrations. Key milestones marked this era, including the release of Bold&#x27;s debut album Speak Out in 1988, which shifted toward more introspective themes while maintaining hardcore&#x27;s intensity. By the late 1990s, Revelation had established a consistent catalog numbering system, having reached beyond REV 050 and encompassing a diverse array of 7-inches, EPs, and albums that reflected the label&#x27;s evolution.

Expansion and Challenges (2000–2010) During the early 2000s, Revelation Records adapted to evolving musical landscapes by incorporating more metalcore influences into its catalog, building on the label&#x27;s post-hardcore roots while reflecting the West Coast scene after its relocation to California in the late 1990s. Bands like Himsa, with their 2001 EP Death Is Infinite, and The Warriors, who released War Is Hell that same year, exemplified this shift, blending aggressive riffs and breakdowns with hardcore energy to appeal to a broadening audience. These releases highlighted the label&#x27;s embrace of heavier, metallic elements, contrasting earlier straight-edge punk focuses and helping sustain interest amid changing tastes. Operational adjustments became necessary as the music industry faced digital disruption.

Their follow-up full-length, Don&#x27;t Forget the Struggle, Don&#x27;t Forget the Streets (1987, Revelation #4), expanded on this foundation with anthemic calls to action that embodied the unpolished aggression of early NYHC, influencing subsequent generations of hardcore bands through its street-level authenticity.
