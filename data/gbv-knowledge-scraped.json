(February 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this message) Formation and early years (1983–1991) Formed in Dayton, Ohio, in the early 1980s, Guided by Voices began their career as a bar band working the local scene. As lineups and day-jobs shifted, however, Pollard moved the band towards a studio-only orientation. Guided by Voices' recording career began with a stream of self-financed, independent releases beginning with the R.E.M.-inspired E.P. Forever Since Breakfast and followed by the albums Devil Between My Toes, Sandbox, Self-Inflicted Aerial Nostalgia, and Same Place The Fly Got Smashed. With only a few hundred copies of each album being pressed, these tended to circulate only among the band members' family and friends. Lo-fi era (1992–1996) With the release of the ultra-limited album Propeller in 1992 (of which only 500 copies were pressed, each with a unique, handmade cover), Guided by Voices for the first time gained some recognition outside of their hometown. This was due in part to gaining fans in the college rock circuit and bands such as Sonic Youth, R.E.M. and The Breeders. New York City and Philadelphia were host to Guided by Voices' return to the live stage (and first shows outside of Ohio) in 1993. At this time, the always-fluid Guided by Voices lineup coalesced a",

Sprout, who was briefly featured in an early-'80s version of the band, had re-joined circa Propeller and soon became Pollard's primary musical foil, in addition to contributing several of his own songs to the band's catalog. 1993 also saw the release of Vampire on Titus, as well as the Fast Japanese Spin Cycle and Static Airplane Jive EPs. Over the next year, the band began to receive national media exposure from sources such as Spin magazine. In 1994, after culling both new songs and reams of archival recordings from GBV's history, Pollard delivered the indie landmark Bee Thousand via Scat Records, with a distribution deal through indie label Matador Records. Soon, the band officially signed with Matador, concurrent with Pollard and his bandmates finally retiring from their day jobs to work in music full-time. The band surprised early audiences accustomed to the generally shambling, lo-fi and collage-like quality of the records with their energetic live show, featuring Pollard's homegrown rock theatrics (consisting of karate-kicks, leaps, Roger Daltrey-inspired mic-twirling, later beer can throwing at rival bands), Mitch Mitchell's windmilling and chain smoking, sometime bassist Greg Demos' striped pants, a never-ending barrage of tunes that all seemed to clock in under 90 seconds, and prodigious alcohol consum",

The band's underground following continued to grow, with notices coming from mainstream sources such as MTV and Rolling Stone. After sessions for a concept album entitled The Power of Suck were aborted, the band assembled Under the Bushes Under the Stars out of their first 24-track studio sessions, recorded with Kim Deal and Steve Albini among others, in 1996. However, the strain of heavy touring would ultimately lead to the demise of the \"classic lineup\", with Sprout deciding to retire from the road in order to focus on raising his first child, his painting, and his solo musical career. Sprout and Pollard marked the occasion by releasing simultaneous solo albums on the same day in 1996: Sprout's Carnival Boy and Pollard's Not in My Airforce, with each making a guest appearance on the other's album. Pollard maintained an active, parallel solo and side project career alongside GBV releases for the remainder of that band's existence. Major label records (1997–2001) Pollard formed a new incarnation of Guided by Voices with members of Cleveland group Cobra Verde in 1997. The following album Mag Earwhig!, combined a new hard-rocking swagger with classic lo-fi fragments and one track, \"Jane of the Waking Universe\", that featured the classic lineup for one last time.

Cobra Verde's Doug Gillard was tapped for yet another new Guided by Voices lineup in 1998, which also included \"classic\"-era bassist Greg Demos, former Breeders drummer Jim Macpherson, and eventually, former Amps/Breeders guitarist Nate Farley. Departing from Matador, this lineup (without Farley) worked with producer Ric Ocasek to create what was intended to be Guided by Voices' major label debut. Initially produced for Capitol Records, Do the Collapse was repeatedly delayed and finally released in mid-1999 on pseudo-indie label TVT. (In the UK it was released on Creation Records). Featuring a slick, heavily processed sound previously foreign to GBV albums, Do the Collapse failed to garner radio airplay, and was for the most part greeted with mixed reviews. Through touring heavily throughout 1999 and 2000, Guided by Voices' live act became legendary, with shows often stretching past the three-hour mark, and populated by an endless stream of new and classic songs, Pollard solo tracks, impromptu covers of The Who, David Bowie and The Rolling Stones, all accompanied by continuous alcohol consumption. In addition to multiple swings through the United States and Europe, 2000 saw the band's first and only visits to Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. 2000 was capped with the release of the m",

Though the album debuted in Billboards top 200 and received higher critical notices than its predecessor, it did not achieve the sought-after radio breakthrough. Later years (2002–2004) After departing from TVT in 2002, Guided by Voices returned to Matador and released Universal Truths and Cycles, a departure from the previous two radio-aspiring albums, and a return to the band's mid-90s, mid-fi aesthetic. Universal Truths producer Todd Tobias would also record the band's final two albums for Matador. 2003 saw the release of the prog-styled Earthquake Glue, followed by the anthology box set Hardcore UFOs: Revelations, Epiphanies and Fast Food in the Western Hemisphere and the greatest hits compilation Best of Guided by Voices: Human Amusements at Hourly Rates. In 2004, Pollard announced he was disbanding Guided by Voices following the release of the Half Smiles of the Decomposed LP, and a final farewell tour.

Their last television appearance was on Late Night with Conan O'Brien on December 2, 2004. They played the single, \"Everybody Thinks I'm a Raincloud (When I'm Not Looking)\". After a select round of final US shows, Guided by Voices played their final show at The Metro in Chicago on December 31, 2004. The four-hour, 63-song marathon finale is documented on the DVD The Electrifying Conclusion. Post-GBV (2005–2009) Lead singer and principal songwriter Robert Pollard in 2006 Pollard released his first post-GBV album in 2006 on Merge Records. The album, titled From a Compound Eye was a double LP produced by Todd Tobias. Later Pollard albums have been released on Merge and Pollard's own label, Guided by Voices Inc. The GBV song \"Everyone Thinks I'm a Raincloud (When I'm Not Looking)\" was featured in the soundtrack for MLB 2K6. Following GBV's demise, Pollard was frequently asked about band reunions. In 2007 he told MAGNET: \"To me, it's just cashing in. If you're gonna get the band back together, it should be to support a new record, not just to play the hits. That's like doing the county-fair circuit. I don't see Guided By Voices reforming. For one thing, there were 50 or 60 people in Guided By Voices over time.\" Pollard also commented on the fact that GBV and his solo output are basically the same, when he told Harp mag",

I tell them basically that there is no difference; I am Robert Pollard and I am Guided By Voices.\" In 2008, Pollard admitted to almost bringing GBV back for his album Robert Pollard Is Off to Business but decided against it, instead forming a new label titled Guided by Voices Inc. The 1998–1999 lineup of the band reunited for a few songs, for Pollard's 50th birthday in 2007. In October 2008, it was announced that Guided by Voices' music would be used for a 3-D film musical based on the life of Cleopatra to be directed by Steven Soderbergh with script by James Greer. Soderbergh and Greer would rewrite the lyrics of the songs to fit the story. Soderbergh had previously used a Guided by Voices song in his film Full Frontal, and wrote an introduction to a book on the band. Pollard wrote the soundtrack to Soderbergh's film Bubble, and that music was released as Music for 'Bubble'. Guided by Voices and Pollard posters, t-shirts, and songs appeared frequently on British sit-com The IT Crowd.

On January 4, 2012, the band performed their single \"The Unsinkable Fats Domino\" on the Late Show with David Letterman to promote Let's Go Eat the Factory. During their performance, bassist Greg Demos fell while attempting a dance move. However, Demos was not seriously injured and the band continued to perform their song. The band canceled what was to have been their first post-reunion show in the UK at the All Tomorrow's Parties 'I'll Be Your Mirror' festival at Alexandra Palace, London, in May 2012 as well as a planned appearance at the Primavera Sound festival in Barcelona. The band's management denied reports that the cancellations were due to them splitting up again and confirmed they were still working on new material. The band released a second post-reformation LP, Class Clown Spots a UFO, on June 12, 2012.

Pollard attended Northridge High School in the Dayton suburb of Northridge, followed by Wright State University in Fairborn, Ohio, where he once pitched a no-hitter for the baseball team. As a teenager Pollard was in a heavy metal cover band called Anacrusis, and went to arena shows which he likens to those featured in the documentary Heavy Metal Parking Lot. Pollard has said that much of the inspiration for his songwriting has come from time spent hanging out with his high school friends from Dayton, a group he calls \"The Monument Club\". Pollard said of his teenage years: Growing up, I didn't really have any musical talent. I could always sing, but that's it. So I started hanging around with all these weirdoes from Northridge who could play guitar. And I would just watch them, 'Wow, I've got to learn how to do that.' That song 'Hank's Little Fingers' (on Devil Between My Toes) – Hank (Davidson) is the guy that inspired me to play the guitar. He had a deformed hand with these little bitty fingers. After graduating from high school in 1975, Pollard bought a guitar with his graduation money. In college, he began singing in rock bands. Although throwing a no-hitter in college, he eventually abandoned athletics realizing that he wasn't qu",

Towards the end of his senior year at Wright State University, Pollard married Kim Dowler, a home-town girl he had been dating for seven years. Dowler did not go to college herself, but started working right out of high school. After Pollard's college graduation, Dowler supported him for a little while, but he then got a job as a school teacher. It was a job with a lot of vacation time and this meant Pollard was able to pursue his music. But the job rubbed off on him, and Pollard has stated that his years as a teacher inspired songs such as \"Gold Star For Robot Boy\", \"Teenage FBI\" and \"Non-Absorbing\". Pollard has worked at all levels of primary school, from elementary school to middle school to high school. He found the most difficult assignment to be teaching physical science to junior high schoolers. Eventually he settled on teaching fourth graders. He said of his teaching years: \"I never went to the teachers' lounge. But the teachers liked me. In elementary school, there aren't a lot of male teachers, so they liked the fact I was around. They'd say, 'Why don't you come down and hang out with us in the teachers' lounge?' But I would go off and take a nap to try to get",

    "text": "Pollard performing at SXSW 2006 Beginnings Main article: Guided by Voices Pollard started playing music in local cover bands in Dayton, and got involved in a songwriters' guild, but he longed to be the leader of a band. In 1981, he began playing original songs with fellow Northridge High School alums Kevin Fennell and Mitch Mitchell. For two years they recorded in the basement of Pollard's house, and played out under a variety of names (including Instant Lovelies, Acid Ranch and Coyote Call). Then in 1983 Pollard eventually dubbed the project \"Guided by Voices\". At the time he was working part-time as an elementary school teacher. In total, Guided by Voices released 16 full-length original albums between 1987 and 2004, as well as a large number of EPs and compilations. Although known as a lo-fi band that relied on home recordings, in later years the group relied more on professional recording studios and worked with producers such as Ric Ocasek. Initially, Guided by Voices was a band in name only, its members being a revolving cast of musicians, most of whom Pollard kicked out of the band at one time or another. \"In the early days of Guided by Voices, when no one was listening, I was impatient\", Pollard wrote in 2005. \"I used to tire of people in the band very quickly. I had physical altercations with them. I even resorted to bullshit tactics, like telling the band I was quitting and we were breaking up, then forming again a month later with new members.\" To finance the band'",

Between 1986 and 1992, they released six records in this way, recording, pressing and distributing them at their own expense. These records got very little response, and although the pressings ran only to between 300 and 1,000 copies of each, the producers were left with many copies on their hands. In 1992, bowing to the lack of support from family and friends, and to the pressure of unpaid debt, Pollard broke up Guided by Voices after releasing Propeller, which he felt was their best album to date. He then committed to teaching school full-time. However, Propeller impressed the indie label Scat Records, who signed the band to a recording contract. The result was that Guided by Voices got back together in 1993, and played a show that year at the New Music Seminar in New York City – the band's first live date in almost six years. With the release of Vampire on Titus (1993), the band was finally able to perform live around the United States. In August 2004, the band released Half Smiles of the Decomposed, which was intended to be their final album. In 2004, on New Year's Eve, Guided by Voices performed their last show at The Metro in Chicago. In 2010 the main 1990s line-up reunited for Matador Records' 21st birthday. A full tour followed and the band remained together until September 2014. Guided by Voices released its first album in seven years on January 1,",

These albums were typically recorded with a small group consisting of current or former Guided by Voices members, and they were generally considered to informally be part of the Guided by Voices canon, as that band would regularly perform selections from the solo releases in concert. After the dissolution of Guided by Voices in 2004, Robert Pollard launched his official solo career with the release of From a Compound Eye in February 2006. Pollard's recent studio work has eschewed the live-band format, instead relying on the multi-instrumental talents of Todd Tobias, who produced several Guided by Voices albums.

Despite this, Pollard performed two shows in support of his new albums. The first show was on November 30, 2007, in Chicago at The Metro. The second was on December 1, 2007, in Newport, Kentucky (across the Ohio River from Cincinnati) at the Southgate House. After releasing Superman Was a Rocker in January, he announced that he would be leaving Merge Records to form Guided by Voices, Inc., his own record label that will produce his entire musical library.

In 2008, he formed a new band, Boston Spaceships, comprising Pollard, John Moen of The Decemberists and Perhapst, and Chris Slusarenko, who played in the final incarnation of Guided by Voices. The band's first album, Brown Submarine, was released on September 16, 2008, on Guided by Voices, Inc., and was followed by a tour in the fall of that year.

However, once signed to a major label and constrained to the expectation of producing only a single album per 18 months, Pollard began the self-financed and released Fading Captain Series, a series of releases both under his own name, and a wide variety of pseudonyms. In addition to solo and archival releases, Pollard began collaborating with fellow musicians and friends by mail via a process dubbed \"postal rock\" – Pollard would receive completed musical backing tracks, and add his own lyrics and vocals. Albums under the Airport 5, Circus Devils, and Go Back Snowball monikers, among others were produced in this fashion. In December 2006, Pollard announced that the Fading Captain Series was being concluded with the release of Crickets: Best of the Fading Captain Series 1999–2007, a 50-song \"best of\" collection spanning from 1999 through 2007. The bands that used to release works in the Fading Captain Series now release records on other labels, such as The Takeovers' Bad Football coming out on Off Records and the Circus Devils' Sgt.

I’m sure I was likely a good enough job candidate on my own, but I’d like to think that Guided By Voices had a small part in me getting a part-time gig to help offset the no-money prospects of freelance journalism and survive in a city I most certainly couldn’t afford to live in. Admittedly, I became hip to Guided By Voices late in life—but, then again, isn’t that always the case with a band that was formed 15 years before you’re born? It was 2016 and my favorite band at the time, Modern Baseball, had done a “What’s In My Bag?” video at Amoeba Records. Co-bandleader Jake Ewald picked Alien Lanes and explained that the only way he could get into Guided By Voices was by listening to their greatest hits record. I didn’t understand what he meant by that at the time, but I enjoyed the track that Amoeba played after Ewald’s point—which was “Game of Pricks.” For a long time, that was the only Guided By Voices track I listened to, until I finally shuffled Alien Lanes and found the wonders of “Motor Away” and “My Valuable Hunting Knife.” It was in college that I started to understand what Ewald was talking about. Scroll through Guided By Voices’ catalog on any streaming service and you’ll be bombarded with four decades of archives. Pollard has written hundreds of songs, and many of them are at our instant disposal. Though they formed in 1983 in Dayton, Ohio,",

    "text": " the band didn’t make their first record—Devil Between My Toes—until four years later, and they remain unequivocally Ohio. When you grow up here—or in any Midwestern state, to be honest—having local musicians to latch onto is essential. For me, it was Kid Cudi and then Devo, then it was (begrudgingly and embarrassingly) Machine Gun Kelly; in high school, I’d fall in love with The Black Keys, The Breeders and The National; after college, I put my focus on older acts like the Pretenders and the Michael Stanley Band. You take greater stock in buying into the work of the bands who make music where you grow into yourself; its easy to find hope where others have found inspiration. --> But I don’t think I’ve had a relationship with the music of any Ohio band in the last five years that is as intimate as the one I’ve had with Guided By Voices. From Propeller to Bee Thousand to Do the Collapse to their most recent records, La La Land and Welshpool Frillies, the dozens of records the band has created—across lineup changes, changing cultural landscapes and band hiatuses—have become a treasure trove for me and so many others. Even now, I know that I can still tap into the Guided By Voices catalog and find something worthwhile and new and noisy—and so few acts can offer that same kind of still-growing curiosity and depth. Across 38 studio albums (so far) and 40 years, Guided By Voices have changed the DNA of alternative and indie rock forever. It goes so much further than “Game of Pricks”",

    "text": " and Alien Lanes. I can’t think of a more consistent band out there right now, as every entry into their canon is just as good as the one that preceded it and, even at nearly half-a-century in, they continue to challenge and outpace themselves with kaleidoscopic color and vivid construction. It’s an impressive feat, and I’m glad I can share a state with Guided By Voices and their extensive, rewarding history. It’s like seeing your neighbor win the lottery; you aren’t a part of their immediate success, but you can’t help but take a piece of it with you wherever you go. I sent some interview questions to Pollard over email ahead of the recent Guided By Voices anniversary gigs in Dayton this month, and he was kind enough to reply with some insights. Paste Magazine: Being from Ohio, I’m always curious about the various music scenes that have spawned in different corridors of the state. Of course, Dayton birthed great soul and funk acts like Ohio Players, Faze-O, Slave and Lakeside. But it took a turn towards alt-rock when Guided By Voices formed and then the Breeders came later. What did the city’s music life look like when you were starting to really focus on forming a band, and then how did you see it begin to shape in the years afterwards? Robert Pollard: It was pretty cool, at least from my perspective as someone trying to get a foot in the door. There was a handful of interesting bands. The Dates, Toxic Reasons, Dementia Precox. And there were some good venues. The scene did",

There were still good bands popping up, but a lot of the gigs were played in make-shift venues. I say this in sort of a vague way because, honestly, I wasn’t that closely in touch. PM: And Scat records started in Cleveland and had bands like GBV, The Mice and Speaking Canaries, who I really dig. How focal were labels like Scat and Drome in changing the DIY, lo-fi landscape in the state—because even homegrown, beloved acts like the Michael Stanley Band were signed to Epic and EMI. RP: They were important and instrumental in giving bands like ours an opportunity to get their records out to a larger audience, and then maybe go on to a bigger label after that. To ease into that kind of pressure at a little more comfortable pace, not that it’s necessarily important to progress beyond that level of making records. PM: I grew up near Warren, and I feel like there was some point in history where the greater eye of the USA took its gaze away from Ohio—leaving great rock bands from Akron, Cleveland, Columbus as bygones, almost. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame brings folks in from all over, but it never zeroes in on the really incredible world still being built in this state. You’ve traveled all over the country playing GBV tunes a couple dozen times over, but what makes Ohio a home worth not only starting a band in but returning home to once ",

But I like to come home because I love Dayton and the people I’ve met and continue to stay in touch with through not only music, but I would say even more so through the sports that I played most of my young life. PM: When Propeller was called a “farewell record,” how keen were you on really saying goodbye to Guided By Voices—especially when Vampire on Titus came out a year later? Was it a wink or did you really believe that 10 years of being a virtually unknown band had finally become insurmountable? RP: No, we just couldn’t afford financially to make records on our own anymore. So that was going to be it. But then Scat came along and offered us a deal. We were able to continue making records and it just took off from there. Very rapidly, actually. PM: A lot of bands I’ve interviewed have talked a lot about how label resources can change the trajectory of a musical destiny. But back in the 1990s there wasn’t Bandcamp or streaming services making AI-generated playlists that help boost musicians into the public eye. When you signed with Matador and made Alien Lanes, how crucial was that to the band’s survival? If that hadn’t happened, how long does Guided By Voices last? RP: Well, signing to Matador was a fantastic opportunity and actually had been a personal aspiration for a few years. I never thought it was possible, but had it not happened I would have been per",

How willing were bigger alt-rock labels back then when it came to taking a chance and signing more obscure acts? Because not everyone can put out Nirvana’s first album like Sub Pop did. RP: I think the alt-rock labels were kind of looking or hoping for a next Nirvana. Labels just wanna be the one to find a good band. Any good band to be a feather in their cap or make them a lot of money. I think Matador and Sub Pop were in competition in that respect, although I think they both truly care about their artists and want them to make the kind of records they want to. It is a business, though. The only pressure I got from Matador was to stop putting out so many singles and EPs with other labels. They were generous enough to allow us to do it, though. PM: After leaving Matador once Mag Earwhig! arrived, how did that open up a new world of freedom to be prolific and work at your own pace—which was obviously at a much greater clip than what many labels can offer to their rosters? RP: We had an enormous amount of freedom with Matador. Chris [Lombardi] and Gerard [Cosloy] were great. I love those guys. We had far less freedom after that. PM: You’ve worked with many producers over the years, from Ric Ocasek to Rob Schnapf to Steve albini. And you’ve also self-produced quite a bunch.

And that’s why during that period we were working with a lot of different people. Also at that time, the label we were on was looking for a breakthrough hit which never happened. I didn’t care that much. I’ll record an album on a boombox. I also like a semi-polished sharp, big rock sound. The important thing is diversity and I think we’re getting that now with Travis Harrison. PM: Critics weren’t initially stoked about Ocasek’s production on Do the Collapse, but many of them have seemed to soften up about it in retrospect. Did you have a hunch that folks might take the full transition from lo-fi alt-rock to shiny hi-fi as a little jarring? RP: Yeah, I know some people were weirded out by that. We had to give it a shot. I wanted to work with Ric and he wanted to work with us. So we did it and I like it, for the most part. There are a couple of things I would change…maybe a song or two I would replace. I think Doug [Gillard] does some brilliant guitar things. PM: You once said in an interview 20 years ago that your solo work was initially intended to prevent the market from being flooded with Guided By Voices stuff. It’s been seven years since your last solo album, a period where you’ve been tightly focused on Guided By Voices. Do you think there’s still a need to separate some Bob Pollard work ",

RP: With this lineup we’ve hit full stride and there’s no need to break the continuity. It’s a recording formula and chemistry that really works and I don’t want to mess with that. I’ve done a couple of side projects but I really prefer to focus or place more emphasis on the material I work on for Guided By Voices. Also, Guided By Voices is a brand name that even the non-hardcore fans are familiar with. They’ll take a chance on buying a record or checking us out live. PM: Will we ever see another Cub Scout Bowling Pins album? RP: I don’t know. Possibly. PM: You’ve tinkered around with some longer songs recently, like “Who Wants to Go Hunting” or “Slowly on the Wheel”—both of which eclipse the 6-minute mark. Welshpool Frillies has a similar brevity to the shorter stuff you’ve made Guided By Voices a household name with. How has your relationship with runtime changed over the years, now that you’ve amassed thousands of tracks? RP: I have a different method of arranging and structuring songs combining various sections in sort of a collage-like way. Sometimes I combine a lot of the sections and the song just happens to be a lot longer. I just started doing that in like the last six or seven years.

With you as the constant, does ushering in new members open the chance for Guided By Voices to become something even more ambitious or powerful? RP: Yes. Definitely with this current lineup. Everyone is very ambitious to make each album as great as it can be. Very eager for the next one once an album is finished. Now it’s in perpetual motion. PM: I remember reading your SPIN interview from 1994 a while ago, when I was consuming everything Guided By Voices-related that I could find, and you said you’d shoot 100 foul shots a day. What’s your preferred avenue of downtime these days? RP: Spending time with my wife, Sarah and our cat, Nicky or going to a bar with a circle of friends I hang out with. Watching the Reds or the Bengals. I like Ohio State football and basketball. PM: It made sense at the time, of course, but at what point did it become clear to you that leaving teaching and doing Guided By Voices full time was a success? Was there a point where you had that “a-ha” moment, so to speak? RP: I thought it was a successful move immediately. That’s why I did it. At first I didn’t think I would be able to quit working. I didn’t think I could play music for a living. It somehow, in my mind, wasn’t possible. Who does that?

I just had a strong sense of confidence that it would continue. And it has. PM: Thinking about the 40th anniversary shows, was there ever any debate as to whether they’d take place in Dayton? PM: No, I wanted it to be in Dayton. That’s where I started. We had a few different ideas. One was to play at one of the big, outdoor venues, like The Rose or Fraze Pavilion. One was to do another thing like we did with the Breeders, Afghan Wigs and New Bomb Turks at Hara Arena in the mid 90’s. Another one was to perform with the Dayton Philharmonic at the Schuster Center. I really liked that idea because I wanted to experience how it would feel to play with the backing of a full orchestra. I abandoned the idea because I started getting bad vibes about the general atmosphere of the venue and expectations of behavior and I don’t know. Possibly volume, lyric content. I wasn’t sure it would be the greatest experience for not only us, but the fans coming to take in a 40th anniversary celebration. I think the idea of playing the Masonic Temple with a lot of other great bands is the best idea. The most fun for everyone. It also coincides with our annual fan fest.

RP: I’m always thinking of the possibility of wrapping it up. Not recording but playing live. I can’t seem to do it. It’s too much fun and the crowds are still great. We’ve got a lot of good songs to play and we just keep amassing them. PM: With the way the music world works now and most artists write, record, and tour for about two years around every album they make, you’d think it wouldn’t work for the Guided By Voices model. But has it been easy to push against the restrictions of album cycles and keep doing your own thing? PM: I don’t pay attention to cycles, trends and advice. I do what I want. What my heart tells me. I entertain myself first and foremost, and hope that others will enjoy it, too. Matt Mitchell reports as Paste‘s music editor from their home in Columbus, Ohio.

While, for a lot of indie-music fans, that record was the entry point into the wonderful world of Robert Pollard, it was already GBV’s eighth LP. Since then, Pollard and Co. have, despite two hiatuses, released a staggering 35 more full-lengths. And that doesn’t include the prodigious number of records Pollard has put out either solo or with side projects. Although it’s more work than we’re capable of to determine just how many different songs Pollard has officially released in his lifetime, it’s upward of 2,500. While the quantity is staggering—and in a category all by itself—the quality of Pollard’s work is often lost in the conversation because of the sheer volume of music he issues. Two years ago, a MAGNET writer compiled a list of the 500 best GBV-related songs, and while even being responsible for the amount of music that could fill a list that big is a phenomenal achievement, some fan favorites didn’t even make the cut. As any GBV diehard knows, ranking the band’s b",

    "text": "est songs (or albums) is always a fluid situation. Not only is the back catalog daunting and overwhelming, Pollard just keeps cranking out new music. (GBV has released 16 albums in the past seven years alone; by comparison, that’s more LPs than U2 has issued in four-and-a-half decades.) On October 31, Guided By Voices dropped Thick Rich And Delicious, an instant classic that ranks in the top 10 of the band’s full-lengths and contains at least eight songs that will undoubtably make our next top-500 list. As such, MAGNET has chosen Thick Rich And Delicious as the best album of 2025. We recently caught up with the Guided By Voices frontman for a rare interview. The 68-year-old Pollard discussed Thick Rich And Delicious, his visual art and the 44th GBV album, due in the spring. —Eric T. Miller I’ve had a copy of Thick Rich And Delicious since June, so I have gotten to live with it for a while. I had a couple initial impressions of it that have stayed the same since. First, I think it’s the best GBV album in more than two decades. Second, I think these songs would sound amazing live, like that’s how they were meant to be heard. How do you feel Thick Rich And Delicious stacks up to previous GBV albums? And do you plan on doing any live dates or tour anymore at all?Thanks. Yeah, we made a record that would translate better to a live performance more so than anything we’ve done as far as cranking out three-minute power-pop songs is concerned immediately following a decision not to pl",

    "text": "ay live anymore. Doesn’t seem to make sense. But that’s OK because even though I feel too old to get onstage doesn’t mean a record has to sound old or more mature or however you want to describe it. Records and ideas are ageless. Bodies and legs are not. Thanks for the compliment, although it’s difficult for me to assess or compare an album without a certain period of hindsight. I think it’s a really fun rock album. I think the sign of a great album is that people have different opinions about what the best song on it is. From talking to others, that seems to be the case with Thick Rich And Delicious. People have told me their favorite is “Lucy’s World” or “(You Can’t Go Back To) Oxford Talawanda” or “Our Man Syracuse” or “Phantasmagoric Upstarts” or “Captain Kangaroo Won The War” or “Replay.” Personally, I think “A Tribute To Beatle Bob” ranks pretty high within the whole GBV catalog. Do you have a favorite song on it?I personally like “Captain Kangaroo Won The War.” It just feels like a really strong, powerful finale. A great one to wrap up the record. I dig “Lucy’s World” a lot, too, and I agree with you on the Beatle Bob song. I’ve had that title around for a long time and finally figured out what to do with it. You’re the most prolific songwriter in the history of rock ‘n’ roll and have seemingly no problem constantly writing tons of new material. What made you decide to rework, reimagine, renovate and/or revamp older works for numerous tracks on Thick Rich And Delicious",

    "text": "?I drove out to the West Coast with (drummer) Kevin (March) and (bassist) Mark (Shue) on our final tour, and I just had a lot of time to think about old songs and ideas that never got fleshed out or received what I considered to being given the proper time and treatment. Every day—all day—between cities, I would just knock around ideas and write them in my notebook. I would let Mark and Kevin know what I was coming up with, and they seemed delighted. So that motivated me to see the project through to fruition. (Guitarist) Doug (Gillard), Kevin and Mark recorded all of these songs live together in Brooklyn, then you added vocals, and (guitarist) Bobby (Bare Jr.) added some backing vocals. How did that process differ from previous recent GBV albums?We’ve always recorded in a lot of different ways. I used to be more involved in the playing of instruments in the studio. But in recent times, I’ve decided to leave that up to the professionals. I still play on some things sporadically. Those guys just said they’d like to try a more “live in the studio” approach. I think they have a stronger rapport and are tighter. We’ve decided to go with that approach again on the next one, which we’re almost finished recording. We may lose a little sound diversity overall with this approach, but I don’t know. I think it makes a stronger, meatier record in the long run. It’s an experiment in itself, and we get back to: Why would we stop playing live and make these kind of records? I don’t know. We",

    "text": " do what we wanna do. There are three instrumental tracks on Thick Rich And Delicious—fully realized songs, not snippets. What made you choose to do that?I sat down and recorded a bunch of riffs and ideas for intros and outros to see if I could attach some of them to various songs to make them a little more adventurous. Some of them I thought were cool enough to be included on the record as instrumentals, and I think it ended up being a pretty good idea, because to me, they seem like brief interludes or intermissions by a house band or marching band or something in a circus, you know like The Rolling Stones Rock And Roll Circus. It gives the listener a little bit of a lighthearted break. I think it also sets up different sections of the album. They make the album more fun, and it was intended to be more fun. Less serious than usual. As far as I can tell, this is the first GBV album released on your birthday. Was there a reason for that?No. I don’t think about that. As a matter of fact, I thought I had released a lot of albums on my birthday. I think it was always Circus Devils albums that we put out on my birthday. So many bands are doing tours for specific anniversaries of albums, playing them in their entirety. You have never done that. Although I did see GBV play Under The Bushes Under The Stars almost straight through back in 1996 before the album had even come out. Would you ever consider doing something like, say, a 30th anniversary tour next year for Under The Bushes? ",

Yeah, we’ve played entire albums before or right around the release date. We did that with Universal Truths And Cycles. I know people who would love for us to do an anniversary kind of thing. I don’t think that’s gonna happen, but never say never, I guess. You mentioned a new GBV album. I read an interview with (GBV producer) Travis Harrison from October, and he said it doesn’t stray too far from Thick Rich And Delicious. Where does progress stand with the making of the next GBV LP, and do you agree with Travis’ assessment?Yeah, the new one, which is called Lost In The Sun, is along the same lines with the exception that there is absolutely nothing borrowed from the past. They’re all completely new songs. They seem to be somewhat tied together in a conceptual way. I’ve done that sort of thing before with albums like Same Place The Fly Got Smashed and Mag Earwhig. It’s even gonna have another fake band photo on the back cover that I got from a 1971 college yearbook. Twelve songs, all between two-and-a-half and four minutes. You have an art show coming up in June and volume 22 of EAT in the works? What can you tell us about each of them?

It’s gonna have more than 100 pieces with stuff from the past, a few things that I’ve recombined and a lot of new things from EAT Vol. 22, which will come out simultaneously with Lost In The Sun right before the show at the end of May. The show’s called Loud because of the sheer volume of works and the fact that there are a lot of bright, colorful pieces. Also there’s gonna be an entire wall of fake 45s and LP covers. That’s gonna look psychotic. Do you have any favorite albums, movies, TV shows, books, etc., from 2025 you would like to mention?I like the new Vince Gilligan series Pluribus. The Guillermo del Toro Frankenstein. P.T. Anderson’s One Battle After Another. I’m basically just rereading the Carlos Castaneda books. There’s like 10 of them. I read a Delmore Schwartz and a James Dean biography. What else do you have on tap for 2026 and beyond?I don’t know. Make more albums. Write more songs. Make more collages.

Gillard, who has been part of GBV’s ever-rotating lineup for the better part of the past 20-plus years, is an indie rock institution himself, known best for projects like Cobra Verde and Nada Surf. In our conversation, he shared his thoughts, feelings, and experiences working on new music with the band and independently during lockdown, and allowed us to pick his brain on his extensive history as a professional musician.

Doug Gillard © Le Studio A CONVERSATION WITH DOUG GILLARD This conversation has been edited for clarity. You've done some radio DJing your day, which as a former college radio DJ, I found exciting. What were your experiences with freeform radio like in its heyday? Doug Gillard: Mine was the mid- to late- 80s and the early 90s. We played CDs too, but at that time, it was mostly vinyl and cassettes that everyone was in the swing with, as far as queuing things up. And it was fun — its very challenging, though. I always had some dead air because I didnt have something queued up in time. (Laughs) Not every single time, but I was always running from one of the rooms of the record",

But when you think back to the freedom of freeform radio, its pretty lucky we were even able to try doing that. It still exists, but its a little more rare [sic] than it used to be. I tune in to some college radio every now and then. Im in New York, but you dont have to be in New York to listen, to WFMU, which is a very big, premier, freeform radio station. I was at WCSB, which is in Cleveland; the Cleveland area had several great college stations. Most of the stations’ record libraries go back to the late 60s, where you see original issue albums that came in, hoping to be played, with notes from the DJs at the time rating the tracks or leaving little comments on the tracks. Like all the Lou Reed solo records. One station had really early Parliament Funkadelic records — ones you dont see because they were the first two or three records that George Clinton released, for instance, that are kind of rare these days. Just after I graduated, I had a show for the summer, I had a show. [That station] had a Warsaw album, which was Joy Division before the Joy Division. It had markings on it, the stations call letters, but it was cool just to be able to play that and see the vinyl. It probably didnt last long—somebody probably lifted it—but for a history lesson and as a discovery, it was great. GBV are lo-fi pioneers, and the band’s influence still shows",

    "text": " up today as so many DIY musicians purposefully go for a similar sound or simply taking a bedroom recording approach. Why do you think lo-fi recordings have endured, even in 2022? Gillard: [The band] did it out of necessity at the time. It wasnt really to have an aesthetic, necessarily. We did things as professionally as we could. Now we pepper in some lo-fi sounds every now and then for fun, and to make the record sound interesting, but we dont stick to that at all [anymore]. Bob [Pollard] usually wants things to be as non lo-fi as we can make it, pretty much. But I guess it depends on the situation. Things always came together pretty quickly [for us], and they still do, so that is the thread that runs through it. We dont take forever to record. Guided by Voices © Terri Nelles And what do you think of the reemergence of lo-fi as an aesthetic choice, especially in terms of the aforementioned DIY and bedroom artist boom? Gillard: Its okay, as long as its interesting and it doesnt sound like anyone else. I think sometimes people set out to sound like a certain record or a certain band they like, and thats not always the greatest result, ‘cause youve heard it before. I did a record with Bob on four-track way back in ‘98 or ’99; it was just a solo project of Bob’s and mine, and he put it out on his label. I did it on four-track cassette, just the music, and he sang over the music in a studio. I ran the tape at the highest speed and I tried to make it sound as good as I could. I w",

But I think its good [for] if someone wants to go for a tape saturation in doing that, so they can have some more full-sounding, with low-end and more rounded sounds. Thats completely understandable, I dig that myself. You know, warmer sounds, more analog sounds, just by virtue of using tape. I know that that works, so thats really not a bad idea. It’s similar to the look and feeling you get shooting on film, as opposed to digital photography. Gillard: Oh yeah. Film looks so much better. Just compare band photos from recent years to any time film was used. You have such an extensive discography, personally and including GBV records. How do you keep yourself fresh after all these years making and releasing music at such a prolific rate? Gillard: I think of different sounds to use, different guitars to use, maybe just different approaches. Its not anything specific. I also try to integrate different styles of music into things Im writing.

Gillard: Well, the batch of songs we get from Bob is always different from album to album, so its always fun to delve into new songs and try to bring something new to ‘em. Its a collective effort of all the members and our engineer and producer Travis [Harrison], who has no shortage of great ideas when he is putting the record together. Im always trying to find new sounds and effects (or not using effects) on guitar, and what I can bring to it. Maybe a different approach to solos and lead parts. Has the pandemic affected the way GBV wrote and recorded the most recent records, for better or for worse? Gillard: There were periods where we did go into bigger studios through the [pandemic] collapse and isolation drills and things around that time, with producers. Now, we have our own system that we record each album with consistently. There were a couple records where we all did our parts at home and sent them in. There was a record where we were able to get together and record some basics as a rhythm section, even during the pandemic, for those of us who live around the New York area (theres about four of us who do). But it hasnt affected it that much. It’s probably allowed us to make more records, because we werent touring. Aside from a technical and logistical level, it's been a draining time in the world for various reasons. How do you think you dealt with that as a musician?

Guided by Voices at First Avenue in Minneapolis, Minnesota © Tony Nelson, 2018 What have you been listening to over the pandemic? Gillard: A little bit of everything.

A lot of things: jazz, soul, even some electronic stuff. Speaking of music, have you been getting back into watching live music yourself? Gillard: Theres been a few things, but we’re mainly busy trying to play shows when we can. We got back into it, then some things got canceled, then we played intermittent shows, and then things would get canceled again, or postponed.

Bob does a great job of veiling in his lyrics, to where you dont know sometimes what its really about, which is a sign of a great writer. Personally, I havent written any songs about [these current events], necessarily. I tend to try to avoid it, I’ve never really been a very topical writer.

Doug Gillard © Le Studio Guided by Voices at First Avenue in Minneapolis, Minnesota © Tony Nelson, 2018 Sometimes just the temperature of the times inadvertently manifests in how we create things, or the way that things end up sounding. Gillard: True. Sometimes it works the opposite way, where you try to make something sound positive and happy and upbeat, or rocking, just as a form of escapism. How do you think guitar-based pop can remain fun, interesting, and new in such an electronic age? Gillard: I think its always interesting to listen to. Bob and I, and most of us in the band, are of the age where we grew up on that, so its just a medium were used to creating with and something thats definitely still fun to do. And were on our own label, so theres no pressure to make something that sounds electronic or something to stay current. Having said that, we do have synths and electronic sounds in the records weve been doing. Theyre not prominent, but we incorporate",

And given he’s the most prolific musician in the history of rock, he’s already finished number 101. MAGNET asked punk-rock legend and massive GBV fan Mike Watt to interview Pollard to get the backstory. I first got into Bob Pollard’s music when a friend played me a seven-inch that had a few tunes on it. I dug it right from then; it spoke to me. I’ve always wanted him on my Watt From Pedro radio show to ask him about his musical journey. What a mindblow that now I get the chance —Mike Watt What is your earliest music memory?As far as rock ’n’ roll is concerned, because that’s all I remember anyway, it might seem pretty clichéd for someone at my age, but it actually was seeing the Beatles perform for the first time on The Ed Sullivan Show. My entire family watched it. It was a huge event for everyone except my dad. He wasn’t so impressed. He told me a few years after that that the Beatles were good songwrit",

What was the first record you bought?I remember my dad buying me a 45 at a department store called Ontario’s. It was “Count Me In” by Gary Lewis And The Playboys. I’ll never tire of that song because it was my first record. I was hooked and wanted more, but I didn’t have any money. So a friend of mine named Billy Perkins would steal 45s for me from the department store. I’d give him a list, and he’d stick five or six 45s down the front of his pants, stick his dick through the center holes. I know because he showed me how he did it. Then he’d just walk out of the store. You know, “Nothing for me today. Thank you.” When did you first pick up a musical instrument?I used to bang around on cheap guitars and chord organs when I was a little kid. I didn’t know how to play, but I could make a noise and sometimes record it on this small, cheap reel-to-reel machine that I had. I actually bought a guitar with my high-school graduation money and taught myself how to play it in college—at least well enough to become a better songwriter. It was an imitation of an Ovation acoustic guitar called Applause. It looked just like it with the hard-shell, round back, but the strings were really high off of the neck and difficult to depress. It really fucked up my fingers and ultimately made it much easier for me to play when I was later able to afford a good guitar, a 330 model Rickenbacker. Did yo",

    "text": "u have music in school?Yeah, it was just general music class in elementary and junior high. I had Mr. Cox at John H. Morrison Elementary. We call it Jim Morrison Elementary. He cast me in the big school musical production of Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs as one of the dwarves. I shit you not, I was Dopey. I had Mr. Rudolph in junior high, and he was a real prick but a pretty good music teacher. I remember him saying that music is like eating olives: At first you don’t really like the taste, but later it grows on you, and I remember thinking, “Man, he’s totally right.” This was in sixth grade. 1968 or something. I was just beginning to hear more challenging music on the radio, and at first I didn’t really like a lot of it. It was bubblegum up to that point. When did you first start playing with people?We tried to form a band in sixth grade. We were going to be called Jello. My best friend, Scott Sears, could play drums, and I could sing a little, and girls actually thought both of us were cute—so we had the foundation. We couldn’t find anyone who could play guitar, so he would play drums and I would sing along with records. We performed “Proud Mary” at the school talent show and at the parent/teacher conference later that night. We got out of synch with the record, but it still went over really well. The mothers and little girls thought we were adorable. What was the first band you were in?It was the next time I performed before a crowd, and it wasn’t until seven years later",

    "text": ". We called ourselves Anacrusis. It was a musical term I found in a book, which means to start a song on the upbeat. It had a symbol with an upside-down U and a period at the bottom center. We were an arena-rock cover band, so I put a lightning bolt through the upside-down U, and it became our logo. Beneath it I wrote, “Power In The Ultimate Form.” I was a freshman in college, but the rest of the band were in high school, at Northridge, where I graduated. One of them was Mitch Mitchell, who formed Guided By Voices with me. Anyway, the Northridge high-school kids thought we were great until we started doing originals. Then Mitch and I got into punk and new wave and cut our hair really short and were asked to leave the band. That was the beginning of Guided By Voices, even though we didn’t take the name officially until about 1982. Do you remember your first gig? When was it, and what was it like?It was with Anacrusis in 1976 at a venue called Brookwood Hall. It was on a Friday night, and I had classes during the day at Wright State University. I couldn’t concentrate to the point of being nauseated because I was so nervous. We had only practiced three times and only once as a full band, so I thought we would, in all likelihood, humiliate ourselves, and I’d heard that there were going to be 300 kids at the show, and it did end up being a full house. So anyway, the opening band was called Arrival, and their motto was “Rock ’N’ Roll.” Their lead singer was wearing a T-shirt that s",

Goode” and couldn’t do it, so I got a huge surge of confidence because we knew about 25 songs—stuff like “Be My Lover” and “Seasons Of Wither,” and I knew we were going to kick ass. And we did. They booed Arrival off the stage and went nuts for us. I was a jock, and after the show, freaks were coming up to me going, “Dude, I’m sorry, I didn’t know.” How old were you when you wrote your first song? What was it about?I was maybe eight or nine years old. It was called “Corn Country.” I sang it for Superchunk once in the dressing room at a show, and they thought I was nuts. It was a nostalgic song about growing up in the Midwest in the middle of fucking nowhere. In the lyrics, I pretended that I’d moved away and then came back home to “Corn Country.” The title says it all. Do you remember your first recording?Well, I mentioned the primitive reel-to-reel tapes we made, but if you’re talking about in a studio, we recorded our first record in a 24-track studio in Kentucky called Group Effort Studios, and it sounded like shit and we sucked. And no one gave a shit, so I vowed that on the next one, which became Devil Between My Toes, that since no one really cared, I could put exactly what I wanted on it, with no regard to sound quality or performance. I like that record, and I realized that that was the way to do it. What have been your favorite collabor",

    "text": "ations?I dig them all, but it would have to be Circus Devils, hands down. We just wrapped it up after 14 albums. That’s pretty fucking good for a collaborative side project. When you write, does the music come first or do the words? Is it different every time?It’s different with each project, but in recent times I like starting with lyrics. That way, you tend to form different melodies or phrasings around each line or section. I kinda work my way through from start to end, and it creates more challenging or interesting structures. It’s harder to pin down a particular style or genre that way. It’s more psychedelic or progressive in approach, but it’s still very melodic. It’s still songwriting and not just jamming. Sometimes, though, a melody or chord progression comes to me, and I start with it. When songwriting, do you ever start with a title? I ask because that’s always the way I do it.First of all, your titles are great. Yes, I would say about 90 percent of the time I start with a title. It becomes the inspiration for what will come next—for how it should feel and sometimes even what kind of song: Pop? Punk? Anthem? Novelty song? The title sort of dictates where I’m going to take the song. Sometimes when I start writing the song, it takes a different direction. Or when I’m finished, it’s not what I expected, and I’ll change the title. What’s your least favorite song that you’ve written?It was a song on Same Place The Fly Got Smashed called “Ambergris,” because it’s just com",

    "text": "pletely silly and ridiculous, but now I kind of like that one. I would have to say “Hold On Hope” because it’s such a sappy-ass, commercial-radio ballad. Guided By Voices fans really like it, though, and since Glen Campbell did it on his final album, it doesn’t bother me so much anymore. It was originally supposed to be a much heavier recording. That’s the version we’ve put back into the live set recently. Do you ever see yourself “retiring” from music?No. Honestly, I can’t imagine it.

By Brian Stout / 27 January 2026 Thick Rich and DeliciousGuided By VoicesGBV31 October 2025The world of Guided by Voices is a kaleidoscope—fragments of melody, flashes of surreal imagery, and a dizzying number of songs tumbling out year after year, including 14 records this decade alone.Robert Pollard has built a universe so vast and so alive that even longtime fans struggle to keep up, yet the music never loses its spark. While other 1990s indie rock greats imploded or took extended breaks, Pollard took his iconic Dont Stop Now to heart, barreling forward, evolving their sound, but still delivering the hooks that have captivated diehards for decades. The man cannot stop, and I never want him to try.Last year, Guided By Voices released two full-length albums, and the most recent, Octobers Thick, Rich, and Delicious, was named album of the year by Magnet. If, for some reason, you have been daunted by the bands discography, Thick, Rich, and Delicious is a great entry point, along with those classic 1990s r",

Would explaining that nary a song runs over three minutes help? Okay, I can make it even easier: start with the most recent albums banger Replay, which encapsulates everything that makes GBV indispensable in a little under three minutes.Pollards got nothing left to prove to anyone, but quality control is still very much on his mind. With the number of other projects under the Pollard umbrella, it would be difficult to decide where to put everything. One thing is sure: no idea is ever off the table for good, even if it has been lingering for decades.Thick Rich and Delicious by Guided By VoicesIts just an intrinsic thing, Pollard tells PopMatters. If it sounds like something I havent done before, or it doesnt seem too rehashed, Ill keep it around and see if I can work with it or flesh it out. Sometimes I know immediately whether I should abandon the idea. Occasionally, Ill use a song idea that I gave up on 20 or 30 years ago. I may decide that it works now.However, Pollard does take special care in selecting the songs that make it into the groups canon.Especially more recently, I designate songs that I think are more suited to be Guided by Voices songs or fit in with whatever Guided by Voices project Im currently working on. I feel that Guided By Voices material should be more mature than it was 30 or s",

I really dont overthink the process, though, he explains.Fortunately, hes got an incredible group of musicians joining him. The current lineup of the band is the best ever (Yeah, I said it. Have you been to a show in the past few years? No better way to spend a beer-soaked evening). Doug Gillard, Kevin March, Mark Shue, and Bobby Bare, Jr. bring fire and precision to the more recent as well as the classics, and Pollard credits their role in the bands continued run of excellent releases.Well, first of all, theyre all extremely talented and locked in with one another, Pollard beams. Its chemistry, but it also has to do with enthusiasm, not just for the songs or particular album project, but just pride and appreciation to be working in a band as productive and, I think, even as well respected and appreciated as Guided by Voices. Those combinations create the necessary chemistry to ensure success for the project. Its about giving each song the attention that it needs.Theres also the matter of each records sound, which has ranged from decidedly lo-fi to the polish of the early 2000s releases. Most recent records have found the sweet spot between polish and grit, but this is not solely driven by a desire to smooth out the bands sound. With Pollards nonstop commitment to writing, songs take many shapes.Each song or album has a different expectation, he explains. You just give it",

    "text": " what it needs based on its tone or feel. Some songs feel more serious or emotionally uplifting, or even more accessible to a wider audience, so you may want to give them more polish or more attention to sound and detail. It always depends on the type of song. Some songs come straight from the boombox live or maybe a four-track version. An album can dictate the types of songs that go on it and what sort of sound fidelity is or isnt necessary.Another trademark of the GBV sound is Pollards famously surreal lyrics, which are as much fun to read as they are to sing at the top of your lungs at a show. Years ago, a fan created a Pollard song title generator. Much like the riffs, the words are constantly spilling out of Pollard.A lot of times its a stream of consciousness, and then I revise to fit the melody, chord progression or song structure. I keep looking at the lyric and sort of chisel away at it to ensure it has enough of that balance between everyday and surreal. Its mostly about the way a line sounds and the way lines flow together to match up with the melody, phrasing to the best of my ability, without trying to overthink. Sometimes I do anyway. Sometimes I just say fuck it, thats good enough, he explains.Even though the band doesnt have tour plans for 2026, a truly heartbreaking bit of news, there is still plenty in store for the faithful, including an exhibit of Pollards art that will be shown this upcoming summer at the Midland Annex Gallery in Highland Park, Michigan, ",

They had expressed a desire to do the show. Even though I wasnt initially interested, their enthusiasm was infectious and persuasive. Mike said we could show 100 or more pieces and do an entire wall of fake 45s and album covers. It should be fun.There is also progress on a new Guided By Voices album, of course, titled Lost in the Sun, and tentatively scheduled for release before this summers art show. There might also be a new release from side project Rip Van Winkle, another edition of Pollards literary zine EAT, and possibly a long-lost Cash Rivers and the Sinners album. There is also the annual Heedfest, which takes place Labor Day weekend in Dayton and is a gathering of friends and fans from all over the globe. Its a great time for new and diehard fans to come together and be among their people.Robert Pollards universe has never obeyed the usual rules of time, output, or logic. It expands because he keeps imagining, keeps listening, keeps following the spark wherever it leads. Thick, Rich, and Delicious is just the latest star in that constellation, but it wont be the last. For anyone willing to step inside, theres always another pattern forming, another melody flickering to life, another reason to raise a beer with strangers who all have this fandom in common.

I know a lot of kids out there see Bob as some sort of messiah of low-fi, the guru of 4-track or the inventor of the practice-tape-as-LP concept, and while I do find his music entertaining, I see him more as a great pop songwriter and less as a recording guru. Nevertheless, I tracked him down after soundcheck when the supercharged GBV (Cobra Verde + Bob) blew through town in June in support of their new CD, Mag Earwhig (Matador Recs). The secret origins of lo-fi appear here courtesy of John Petkovic, guitarist for GBV and Cobra Verde. And apologies are extended to Robert s wife. People are always writing in and they re saying that you re the candidate they want me to interview. I heard a story that the first time you recorded somewhere you hated it so much you actually burned the master tapes. That was Blue Oyster Cult. You were in that band too?They were called Soft White Underbelly then. I have never actually burned a tape but I have shit-canned a project. I taped over it. We ve had completely finished",

Because of the sound?Yeah, the recording sound and other factors involved like I didn t like the way it was sequenced, but mainly the recording part. I ve never actually burned tape. I may have erased it. A lot of times people thought you were holding up a banner of lo-fi. John Petkovic: I ll tell you why. I ll relate a secret about lo-fi. This is true. You know why he s lo-fi? His wife Kim would not allow him to spend money in a big studio. She won t even let me buy pot. She s the reason for lo-fi. Really. She wouldn t let me buy a four-track. John: That s why there was lo-fi. Musically, all I have to my name is a Harmony guitar that my brother gave me and a really cheap little solid-state tape recorder that my brother-in-law gave me. Is that what you demo stuff on?Yeah. The whole lo-fi thing... we ran out of ideas for that as far as how far we could go with that. You can only go so far with lo-fi. You can only move the amplifiers around the room so many different ways and use so many devices and play on the side of the washer and dryer. You can only do that for so long. It was kind of a dead end for you after a certain number of albums?I like the immediacy and I like the warmth of a lo-fi recording. When I started a band I wanted to make big, good-sounding rock music. It was never a conscious effort to say, Let s be lo-fi. We just retreated",

We re having fun and no one else likes it but we like it so we ll just keep it to ourselves. John: And your wife wouldn t let you spend money on it. I m blowing your cover. I m sorry.That s okay.The last album you did at Easley Studios and I remember reading these stupid reviews which said that your sound had changed drastically. I didn t think that it had changed that much.It s not that drastic. It s not that slick. If you want to hear hi-fi, listen to the new Foo Fighters album. Not to say it s bad, cause it sounds fuckin good. To get a sound like that, you have to pay dearly. You gotta get a producer that costs $100,000. [Someone mentions Steve Albini]You pay Steve Albini what you can afford. He records bands for free if they can t afford it and if a band s on a major label he makes them pay more. He worked with Bush didn t he? I don t know if I should say this but I think we were $1000 a day. John: I think he was working with Bush only so he could get some major label cred. John s opinions do not necessarily reflect mine cause I don t know if John s a big fan of Steve Albini. I like him. You did some stuff with John Croslin (Spoon, Reivers) too.I like John. Was he just coming through town?He came in specifically for that. I think it sounds good but the guitar sound s not very good. That s not his fault, it s the place we recorded.

    "text": " thick-walled little rooms. Maybe he should have said, Bring those out of there. I don t know. He s good. I heard that stuff he did with Spoon and it sounds really, really good. Britt s a good songwriter. So what about the aesthetics of studios?I still want it to sound raw. I don t want it to sound studio-slick. It s a carryover from the basement. We finally got the sound we wanted in the basement and there was only so much we could do with it and now the challenge is to get the vocal sound we like and the noise sounds we like. To try to use that, somehow, in the big studio. You ve got to have a studio you re comfortable with. You ve got to be as comfortable in a big studio as you are in a basement and that s a tough thing. I never did like studios. Too sterile?Too sterile; too removed. Working with engineers that really don t give a fuck about you. They re doing their best just to tolerate you. I would think that at this point there would be a logical progression where there are comfortable studios and there are people who give a fuck about you. There might be some people who are like, I d like them to be lo-fi forever . When would that dwindle? People would start dropping off. Oh, I ve had enough of that. I can t see that an outsider has a place to tell a band what to do in the first place.I don t regret the days of lo-fi, but now if I make a compilation tape of GBV for somebody, I wish that some of these songs were recorded better so the compilation tape would all be big r",

    "text": "ock songs. When we were making lo-fi in the basement we only used a four track. You know how some bands want to be lo-fi. We were more experimental. We wouldn t care if the drums were in sync with the guitars. To me that s not lo-fi. That s just being silly and experimental like the Beatles White Album type stuff. Goofing around and having the freedom to feel like you could do that. But the whole lo-fi thing... at least it opened the doors for us. There was something for us to jump on. Something people could associate our music with. It was a genre that came about because there was nowhere left to go. And then lump a bunch of people together that don t necessarily have the same aesthetics. So what s Cro-Magnon studios (in Dayton, OH)?That s a 24 track setup. They ve got ADAT s. The guy s working there are really cool. They let you do what you want and it sounds good but I don t know. I haven t heard anything come out of there with a big, booming guitar sound. Maybe it s ADAT. I don t know. Maybe they don t know how. I ve heard that when you turn the amp volume down real low, where you can get it real dirty without feeding back, and then you turn it up in the mix.Little tiny practice amps can sound real good.On a song on the new album, The Old Grunt, we had some of those little bitty Marshalls (MS-2 mini amp) and the guitar part in the middle was through one of those.They cut through. Then you turn it up in the mix. Are there any plans for the future. Are you recording after t",

I have the next album written; as a matter of fact it was almost all written in one day. I like them that way. I haven t done that in a long time, where I was inspired to write 20 or 30 songs in one day. How do you like working with Don Depew (at 609 in Cleveland)?Don s good. We were real uncomfortable with each other on this last album but that s gotten better. I wasn t as experimental with the vocal sound as I d have liked to have been. I m real happy with the drum and guitar sounds. I think it sounds good. Was he making you sing through his Peavey mics?Umm, yeah. I heard you were really into some Radio Shack mic.On our four track stuff we did through some Radio Shack... a wide head, wide mouth mic. Do you remember what it was called, what number it had or anything?I don t know. Realistic or something. It was so wide that it captured more, like the whole room or something. That s what we called the Hot Freaks sound. When we first got a good vocal sound was the Hot Freaks song. That s the sound I want to get. I think on the next album I m gonna try to get that in a big studio. We tried to get that on Under the Bushes, Under the Stars and we had to actually use a fuckin four track to do it. And we had to use that mic. I want to try to get that where it sounds like that but it s bigger. Do you play around with effects and stuff?We play around with pedals and si",

What other technical stuff can you think of?Did you say testicle stuff? I got a vasectomy and my nuts got this big (indicates a large area in his lap). Dude, it was purple, it fucked me up and I thought I was gonna die. I had to go back and they cut it open and they squeezed all that puss out.That sounds painful. No, technical questions.You can ask me technical questions but I don t know how much I can answer. You just want to capture the song the way you hear it in your head. That s the art and the difficult part. And you don t want to spend too much time on it cause it loses something if you do.With all these different tracks recorded at different studios... do you record multiple versions of the same songs at different places?Occasionally but not usually. That s been the case for the last couple of albums cause I ve been kind of in the dark trying to figure out how to bridge this gap between lo-fi and hi-fi studios. I ve been just kinda feeling around trying to work with people. The next album s gonna be really solid because I know where I m at and what I want now. Do it all at the same studio?Maybe, but even if I don t I know what I want and where, on the last couple of albums, I wasn t quite sure whether I wanted to be half lo-fi and half hi-fi...

If he wants to come down.Marc Allan: Well, he lives in New Jersey, but-Robert Pollard: Oh, does he?Marc Allan: But yeah, but.Robert Pollard: But, yeah. No. But a lot of that stuff is not available, its just all in the box set, and like, even a lot of the seven-inch EPs are just getting pretty much hard to find. I think City Slang is gonna repress Static Airplane Jive. Some of that stuffs tough to find.Marc Allan: Did you save stuff for yourself? I mean, do you have copies for your-Robert Pollard: Yeah, I have a few of everything, but its down to like, I mean, some things I have like three or four copies of and thats it.

But, you know, I just dont see the point in doing it if Matador is gonna put out, you know, theyll put out anything we want, you know. Except now, theyre pretty slow about it.

We dont really make a whole lot of money live, because theres so much, you know, were a business now, and we have to take out payroll taxes, individual taxes. We have to pay our management 15%. We have to pay our accountant 5% We have to pay our booking agent 10%. We have to pay expenses. See, they get all those before expenses.

I mean, its good money, live, but its not great money. Most of my money is coming from my publishing, as a songwriter. Its just like, thats what Im hoping, you know. Ill be 38 in October, and my hip hurts, my left hip hurts, and shit. And I dont know how much longer I can jump around on stage, and get hammered and shit.

I just dont think that like, because of John, mainly because of John Lennons songwriting, and because of Paul McCartneys sequencing of the record, and the time he took in the booth, that he took in the making the records, putting the records together. I dont think that people can make records that good. And I try to make a record like that, you know. Not necessarily copy The Beatles songwriting style, or what they do. I naturally have a kind of a John Lennon voice. I guess I grew up on John Lennons singing style, McCartney and that kind of thing, the British Invasion. But I try to put a record together the way the Beatles did. The time they took in the sequencing the record. And because we have access to, mainly, weve had access to a four-track, I try to make kind of like a long-lost Beatles bootleg. A Beatles bootleg of like long-lost studio stuff that you cant get anymore-Marc Allan: Yeah. There are times where I think there are songs that sound like The Beatles are goofing around in the studio-Robert Pollard: Yeah. I love when The Beatles are goofing around.Marc Allan: Right.Robert Pollard: Yeah. So I kind of went for that. I occasionally find bootlegs, and I find stuff, studio stuff, where like The Who, or The Kinks, or The Beatles, or whatever, and theyre just like messing around and making up silly shit in the studio.

I like to think that all of our records are semi-conceptual, in just the way that theyre put together. Like Alien Lanes, to me, is kind of like youre tuning into this weird radio station from another dimension, except theres no DJ, they just all combust together. So like all the records seem to have, theyre a little bit conceptual, kinda like The Who Sell Out, or like Sgt. Pepper, that kind of thing, yeah.Marc Allan: You taught school for 14 years. Fourth grade, right?Robert Pollard: Mm-hmm.Marc Allan: Okay. What do you think of kids? Are kids getting dumber?Robert Pollard: Well, kids are getting, actually, technically smarter, with computers, and video games, and all that shit, but I dont know, maybe in commonsense-wise, maybe they are, I dont know. I dont know. Some of the stuff they listen to. I gotta be happy with kids. You know, kids are like paying my bills right now. I have to be happy with them, man.

My doubts were quickly cleared-up when I got to see them in 1995, first at Reading Festival and then in Brighton. The Reading set was relatively short, maybe only 40 minutes, but they packed it with so much energy and intrigue. Beginning with A Salty Salute , Game of Pricks and My Valuable Hunting Knife , they sounded superb and the songs were so much more powerful than on the records. A week or so later in Brighton, they played a full set and it was even better. They played with just the right mix of knowing what they were doing but also clearly having a good time and not worrying about the technical details ( Close enough for rock n roll , as a wise man once commented ) There were so many comparisons to be made, although none too obvious or direct, but I remember thinking of The Replacements, early Wire, The Saints, maybe even Creedence What was clear was that they had a real talent for creating catchy, original songs and just the right attitude to deliver them. After interviewing the band a couple of times, I was able to arrange to release a 7 featuring two songs recorded at that Brighton gig. It s possibly my favourite out of all the Fear Loathing singles The so-called classic line-up (Robert Pollard, Tobin Sprout, Mitch Mitchell, Kevin Fennell, Greg Demos) came to an end but in their place, Bob brought-in Doug Gillard and Nate Farley who provided the core of the new line-up",

Over the next decade I got to see the band every time they played in London and, as it became clear that no two shows were ever the same, made a point of trying to see them in other towns as well. (Here s a little-known fact ; when I saw GBV play Liverpool in 1999, they hung-out and shared their beer-rider with the then-unknown opening band Coldplay !) But things came to an end in 2004, when Robert Pollard announced that the band were splitting and would be playing a farewell tour, but only in the States. Fortunately, I d been saving-up for a holiday and was able to book it to coincide with gigs in Portland and Seattle. It was sad to think that I d probably never see the band again, but at that point Bob was already working on his first post-GBV solo releases and planning to continue touring, so I didn t think there s be long to wait before seeing him again. Unfortunately, this wasn t to happen. None of Bobs ensuing projects ever came to the UK or Europe, but in 2010 it was announced that the classic GBV line-up would be reforming to play live once again. They would also release several new albums over the next four years and at one-point they were even scheduled to play at an All Tomorrows Parties event in London, although this was mysteriously cancelled (as would happen with several subsequent ATP events ) In 2014, the classic line-up came to and end for a second time, but Pollard con",

Initially featuring drummer Kevin March from the 2001-2004 band , they would also include Doug Gillard by 2016, meaning that the band now included three members of my own favourite line-up New albums followed and with the return of Gillard the band certainly sounded revitalised, combining Bob s song-writing talent with musicians who really knew how to bring out the best from the songs. However, it would not be until 2019 that UK fans finally heard the news they d been waiting for, when two London dates were announced. They promptly sold-out quicker than you could fetch a cold beer from the cooler ! It was obviously time for me to catch-up. I approached the UK Press agent to see if they could set-up an interview for me, but they d been told that Bob wouldn t be doing any interviews prior to the visit to London. Fortunately, I still had some contacts for the band over in the States and through these (thanks Rich and Amy !) I was able to get a message to Mr Pollard. Although being cautioned again that Bob doesn t do many interviews these days, I got a reply back a few days later saying that Bob would be happy to do an interview with me by email, as he though I was a good dude !

Greatly. I miss it, but I just don t travel as much as I used to. Are you aware of the interest that s built-up around Guided By Voices in those intervening years ? There seems to be a lot of fans here now that didn t have a chance to see GBV the first time around Well, if you stick around long enough, people start to recognize the name and I also think there s a new generation whose parents turned them on to Guided By Voices. I see kids in the audience who know all the words, not just to the old stuff but for the new songs as well. That s what really makes it worthwhile and fun. How come it s been so long since your last UK visit ? At one point, the classic line-up was announced to play in London, but that fell through for some reason The reunion of the so called classic line-up\" was a bit of a disaster. It was fun and interesting initially, but it got stale fairly quickly. After a while, we seemed to be going through the motions and then the same cycle of events occurred that caused the break-up of that band the first time around. But things have really picked up again with the new line-up since then and a lot of people seem to be excited, so we decided it would be a good time to visit some places we haven t been to in a while.

We ll play about a 50/50 split of new and old songs. I realize people like the old records but they re going to get a heavy dose of material from the new ones, too. We will be supporting two new albums; Zeppelin Over China and Warp and Woof so it s mostly brand new stuff or songs from 93-2001 and not so much mid-period or classic line-up\" material. Your set-lists tend to be pretty lengthy but still vary from night-to-night. When you go out on tour, how many songs do the band have available to be played? Also, with so many different songs (and the regular beers !) have you ever had any problems remembering any lyrics ? We ve got about 60-65 songs we can play and, yeah, I forget the lyrics sometimes and just wing it.

But I haven t been doing this routine very regularly lately, so I d better get on it ! Guided By Voices originally split in 2004 and didn t re-emerge until 2010. Do you think, at the time, it was something that had to be done and, with hindsight, do you think the reformation was inevitable ? Well, in 2004 I wanted to do the Peter Gabriel thing to see how I would go over as a solo artist. But then I remembered that basically, I write all the songs, came up with the name and do all of the artwork, so what s the difference ? Well, the difference is that Guided By Voices became a brand name and so I think it s more identifiable. Not necessarily to the hard-cores, but to music fans in general Your output of work has remained at a very high-rate for many years, with various line-ups, side projects and solo-outings. I ve often wondered, has there ever been a time when you ve suffered from writers-block ? Or have you ever taken a conscious break from music and song-writing ? No, I ve never had writer s block ! As a matter of fact, I have to force myself to take breaks. If I pick up a guitar with a notebook full of titles or lyrics, it just comes to me.

In a lot of ways, it reflects the way you use lyrics for the way they sound, rather than what they re specifically saying ? Yeah, the way I make music and the way I form collages is exactly the same process. Isolating pieces of imagery and then, when I ve got enough ideas, I start moving them around to create a complete picture something that forms a more interesting field of sound or vision than the initial fragments or the images which they were taken from. In the past, your lyrical themes often included schools and aircraft. Do you think they re still a part of what you write, or have other themes taken over ? I don t do a whole lot of the flight or school imagery anymore. I mean, that kind of thing pops up here and there, like a recurring dream or nightmare or something, but I don t really think a whole lot about it. I ve never tried to make any statements, it just seems to be whatever is going on around me at the time.

I d like to have a little bit of mystique by being less visible or accessible, but I think it s more of a matter of letting the music and art speak for itself. I really just don t have a lot more to elaborate on concerning the process or end result. Guided By Voices has always been closely associated with vinyl releases. How do you feel about the rise of downloads and non-physical formats in recent years ? Has it affected your musical output in any ways ? I don t concern myself with technology and availability when it comes to making music. The most important thing is that people hear the music. I prefer the LP format myself, but I don t think it sounds as good as it used to. Some technology seems to have been lost... The ESP Ohio album in 2016 saw you working with Doug Gillard again for the first time in over a decade. He subsequently rejoined the current Guided By Voices, which also includes Kevin March any chance that Nate Farley might return at some point ? I love Nate and I still see him occasionally. He comes to shows sometimes and, unlike some ex-members of Guided By Voices, he s always been supportive. So I don t wanna close the door, but we're very close knit right now.

I ve actually got a collage with the same title and I ve been doing that a lot lately. The riff at the end was always intended for Lurk of the Worm , but I do very often mix and match. One thing I ve noticed over the years is that Guided By Voice s audience is pretty indefinable. People that I think will really love the band just don t get it, while others who would seemingly have very different tastes, love it ! Do you think that s why the popularity of the band has been so enduring? Yeah, it s not for everybody but it appeals to a select few almost everywhere in the world. And that select few may change, grow or diminish at different points in time There are so many influences that go into my songs that they re difficult to identify, so it makes them appealing to different people and creates a sort of originality. Similarly, I ve always thought the band has had a very punk rock approach to what they do. In a lot of ways, GBV have always been a band made up of people who, in regular terms, shouldn t be in a band, let alone onstage true underdogs ! I mean, a school teacher from Ohio ???

If you ve never actually heard them, I suggest the excellent compilation Human Amusements at Hourly Rates , which serves-up 33 songs from the 1987-2003 period and includes many of their very best. If you are an ongoing fan, the recent albums Space Gun , Zeppelin Over China and Warp and Woof are proof that the band are back on top-form, so be sure to check them out. If you ve already got tickets for the upcoming shows in London, I m sure you re going to enjoy them but if you haven t, do yourself a big favour and find a way in.

(By the way, I was inspired to write about GBV thanks to a great podcast by Jeff Gomez called Self-Inflicted Aural Nostalgia, which covers every Guided by Voices album.) Robert Pollard, like so many other indie musicians, wanted to be a rock star. He was born in 1957 in Dayton, Ohio, and he grew up loving the music of The Beatles, the Who, and King Crimson. He began forming bands in the ‘70s, and in 1983, one of those projects became Guided by Voices, a band that specialized in anthemic lo-fi rock. Between 1986 and 1991, GBV released four albums, all recorded in basements on four-track cassette. Although the band and their manager, Pete Jamison, believed in GBV, apparently no one else did. They played a handful of gigs in Dayton, Ohio and audiences hated them. Their anthemic albums didn’t sell and all the while Pollard’s family was pleading with him to stop wasting money and time on his band, hoping he would focus on his wife and kids and his teaching career. Finally, Pollard decided that perhaps his music career just wasn’t meant to be. But he decided to go out with a bang by releasing what they hoped would be their best album yet. He scraped together some money and whatever songs he had left and recorded 1992’s Propeller. They pressed 500 LPs in plain white sleeves and then hand-decorated every cover with a unique design. (You can see many of the designs here.) After that, Bob broke up the band. There was no fanfare.",

    "text": " No mourning by fans, because there were no fans. GBV simply ceased to be, just like so many indie bands before them and so many after. And that was that. RIP, GBV. Except not quite. Turns out their manager sent a few copies out to some industry folks, one of whom was Robert Griffin at Cleveland’s Scat Records. Griffin fell in love with Propeller and called Pollard up to sign the band. Pollard thanked him for his interest but said there was no band anymore. However, they finished the conversation with Pollard saying he’d see what he could do. Seven days later, Pollard sent him a cassette of new recordings, what would become The Grand Hour EP. Scat requested more material from GBV, and the band delivered Vampire on Titus, which was their lowest-fi record yet (and that’s saying something). At first, Griffin found this puzzling, but rather than request new songs or better recordings, after repeated listens, Griffin realized he had an album that sounded like nothing else, so he released it. The critics loved it, with Entertainment Weekly — incredibly — giving the album an A+ review. I’m amazed at the review, not because the album is bad, but it’s hard to imagine a mainstream publication giving such a glowing review to an album that features muddy production with vocals buried so low in the mix as to be practically inaudible, perhaps best exemplified by Robert Pollard/Tobin Sprout song “Sot.” The band responded to the hype with what is widely considered their masterpiece, 1994’s B",

Cobbled together by still more unreleased songs, Bee Thousand quickly became one of the most influential albums of the year (it was ranked as the 10th best album of the 1990s by Pitchfork). Suddenly this band that had ceased to be in 1992 due to lack of interest was now, in 1994, “the next big thing.” Soon the major labels, including Warner Bros., came sniffing around, but Pollard chose Matador Records, whose roster included other alternative artists he admired. The band received a $100,000 advance on their next album. It was basically every musician’s dream: suddenly the world woke up and realized how amazing Pollard’s music was. There was no compromising or “selling out” by the band. They were making music the same way they had been for a decade; it’s just that audiences were ready to hear it. (It doesn’t hurt that other lo-fi artists were making it big at the same time, e.g. Beck and his massive hit “Loser.”) According to bassist James Greer, “The cost for recording Alien Lanes, if you leave out the beer, was about ten dollars.” He’s not exaggerating. Rather than take the money to go into a “proper” studio, the band just did what they did best: they recorded the album in various band members’ basements on a Tascam 4-track PortaStudio cassette recorder. Hearing these two albums today is a refreshing experience for any musician.

That song, by the way, is the lead-off track to the album. 99% of musicians and producers would be horrified by that gaff and force everyone to play the song again. GBV didn’t care. They knew if they over-thought it or practiced it too much, they’d lose the magic. Greer describes recording “Game of Pricks,” and it’s a perfect illustration of how their method captured that magic: By the time I got there Bob was playing guitar, as usual, running through a new song with Kevin two or three times until [drummer Kevin Fennell] understood the structure, which was not overly-complicated. I didn’t at first fully understand what was going on, which is to say that we were in fact already recording the song, and that this was the way we often recorded songs. When Bob was satisfied that Kevin had grasped the structure, he turned to [Tobin “Toby” Sprout] and said, “Okay, let’s do the vocals.” Toby had in fact been recording each of the two or three run-throughs, and I should emphasize that this was a song no one besides Bob had ever heard before. Bob put on a pair of headphones, picked up the mic, and sang in o",

I’ll admit to a slight panicky feeling, especially when I listened to the song through the headphones and could barely make out the chord progression under Bob’s vocal, which was hypnotizing not just for the beauty of the melody but for the weirdly plangent lyrics. Everyone was watching me (I thought). Everyone was judging me (I thought). In fact no one was watching, and no one cared, but on my first run-through I flubbed badly a couple of the transitions. Bob picked up the guitar and ran through the structure standing in front of me, in double time. I got most of it, and had another go at recording. Somehow, I got through a mostly mistake-free take, and by the end had finally figured out what I wanted to do; but we were done. I don’t mean just that I was done. The song was done. And when I heard the mix that Toby played back a few minutes later, I realized: the song was perfect. Compare that version, found on Alien Lanes, to the single, which was re-recorded at Matador’s request, a few months later. According to Greer, “The re-recorded version, done in a local studio, reflects the fact that we’d been playing the song live for quite a while already. In addition to the added intro section, which Bob came up with in the studio, we played it faster, tighter, and with a few more embellishments (harmonies at the end, additional la",

While Bee Thousand is the more critically acclaimed album, I prefer Alien Lanes, which, IMHO, is tied with The Beatles (aka The White Album) as the most perfectly sequenced album of all time. The whole thing clocks in at just 41 minutes but features 28 songs. Seven songs are less than a minute long; the longest is under three. Some of which are fist-pumping rockers like “Watch Me Jumpstart,” while others are fragments of songs, like the 18-second long “Cigarette Tricks.” Not only did the band record quickly, they recorded everything, and they included songs most bands would leave on the cutting room floor and then burn the master tape afterwards. But the cumulative effect of all these songs and fragments adds up to more than just an album, it’s a mini-universe. And these fragments never overstay their welcome. “Pimple Zoo” is a good example of this. Listening to the album is, thanks to its wide-ranging aural diversity, akin to hearing a series of Vine videos playing in the next room, if those Vines were curated like the greatest mixtape by your coolest friend. To properly listen to the album, you need to hear it without interruptions between tracks, so don’t listen to it via Alexa, like I did. Instead, listen to it on vinyl, CD, or even Spotify. The sequencing is so important, I can’t hear one song end without expecting the next one to begin, like how the short “Auditorium” leads perfectly into",

If the recording captures the song’s essence, don’t worry if Kevin messed up the bassline. Got a song that doesn’t work, but there’s this one 15-second bit that kills? Keep that bit, get rid of the rest, and keep recording! Pollard is still recording today. He is currently credited with having written over 2,000 songs. Had he hung up his music career for good in 1992, one wonders what he would have done with all that creative energy. The latest Guided By Voices album, Space Gun, just came out in March 2018.

I had just gotten out of high school and, at this point, was a Pitchfork true believer. I read every article and listened to everything the music site gave an even slightly positive review to, so it made sense to pack up and head to the fest that shared its name. It was a hot and sweaty affair, a throng of Ray-Ban-wearing hipsters. I was mainly there to experience the danceable psychedelia of the headlining act Animal Collective. While zealously holding my spot in the front row, I was privy to quite a few bands, only two of which I remember now. There was the rather unbelievable instrumental gymnastics of Battles. Then there was Guided By Voices from Dayton, Ohio, who were often referred to as seminal to the history of indie rock. Pitchfork ranked Bee Thousand as one of the best of its decade, so I was s",

Surrealist, nonsense lyrics, lo-fi production, post-punk leanings, these are phrases that came into my brain that, back then, I was particularly interested in simplifying and labeling everything. When I first listened to their song “Hardcore UFOs, I imagined a group that looked something like Pavement, who, in my mind, had the proper approach to rock attitude: sarcastic, skinny college guys wearing ironic, slacker fashion, who maybe moshed a little on stage here and there but always with an art school eye roll. When Guided By Voices took the stage hours into my vigilant clutching of my first-row spot, I assumed there had been some mistake. Surely, this was somebodys dads bar band. There was nothing slacker, college, or even “indie” about what I saw erupting before me. First off, they were visibly older than I ever expected. Singer Robert Pollard was white-haired and scrawny, and even stranger, was whipping his microphone around like a lasso in a reverent and unironic homage to “Rock and Roll Dinosaur” Roger Daltrey of the Who. There were no Ray-Bans in sight. The guitarist wore regular dad-style sunglasses and slime-green pants and drank heavily from a bottle of Jack Daniels while miraculously keeping a cigarette cemented to his bottom lip at all times. The bass player was dressed like a pirate. He held aloft his instrument as if it were ejaculating holy water. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JFbh",

Performance art? Did the real black-rimmed glasses-wearing wallflower members send their dads to play their songs? It couldnt be. That voice that shouted “Gold Star For Robot Boy” like it was a campaign slogan was undeniably the voice from my illegally downloaded MP3 file.Furthermore, that voice was not the only one I was hearing; beside me was a true believer, a fan (Guided By Voices fans, I would soon learn, were only one notch away from the zealousness of Grateful Dead followers). He was a slightly older guy who shouted every single word, raising his beer in celebration, irreverently shouting between songs. I had not seen such a display of outright hero worship and “rocking out” for any other act that day. At first, my reaction was a sort of snotty annoyance, but slowly, deep down, I started to feel a sort of longing, like I was missing something. Over a decade later, I am convinced I was missing something because I now believe that on that day, I saw one of the all-time great examples of what we call a rock band.

The band began in earnest 15 years before in Dayton, Ohio. They were working-class Midwesterners who, at first, pulled together what little money they could to go to “a real studio” and make “a real professional” album, hoping to create something that might fit in alongside up-and-coming acts of the day like R.E.M. or the Replacements. The old cliché goes something like this: for every band that “makes it big, there are a million who dont make it out of their garage, and indeed, Guided By Voices first professionally recorded EP went nowhere. In response, they never really gave up on being a band, so much as maybe started adjusting their expectations as many bands do when they dont immediately become the Beatles. Bee Thousand by Guided By VoicesIn hindsight, the year I saw Guided By Voices at Pitchfork was the beginning of a turning point for my music and art endeavors. Valley Girls, the band I was in (and am still in), recorded in “a real studio” later that year and shelled out some money to make it all look official. We sent it around to record labels and gave it a fair shake, but we didnt exactly wind up on Pitchforks front page. In the years that followed, our enthusiasm for creating never truly wavered, but teenage dreams about being some world-renowned rock band seemed more and more like",

As so many do, we discovered our local scene and further an entire midwestern network of artists, all creating together and encouraging one another in DIY venues and communities. Expectations for the future were slowly set to a more “realistic” but fulfilling level. Unlike my band friends and me, Guided By Voices had families to support, the stakes were higher in some ways, and the band did not appear to find much fulfillment locally, being relatively unknown even in Dayton for their first ten or so years as a band. I cant help but infer from what Ive read that my fellow Ohio rockers had a healthy amount of skepticism about “making it” from the get-go while never quite losing sight of their aim, which was at the stratosphere of rock. Dayton, Ohio, is not New York or Los Angeles. It had always been a long shot. They werent art school kids or the sons of oil barons. They took out loans and shouldered debt to create their first releases.Their power pop tracks did not take the radio by storm, despite Robert Pollards apparent ear for catchy melodies, and as if in response, the band increasingly let things slacken, breathe, and get weird. They became a self-described “songwriting collective” of sorts, with Pollard being the only consistent member, recording with whoever would show up to play and record, more often than not in Roberts",

Imagine finding out that you decided not to play on a track that would eventually be considered an indie rock anthem because you felt like watching TV or going to the bar that night instead. We all make our own choices. In the years after their first EP, Guided By Voices became a little less of a business venture and more of an arty hobby for a few drinking buddies whenever they had time away from their families or day jobs (the status of the majority of bands that have ever, and will ever form). Their energetically spontaneous approach spawned song after song (Pollard is notorious for sometimes writing multiple in a week) with little care for some dramatic album release model, which now seems like a sort of precursor to artists who record in their bedrooms and share spontaneously on internet platforms like Soundcloud and Bandcamp.While this method is freeing and expressive, as many DIY artists know, sustaining the energy can sometimes be challenging without audience feedback. By the early 1990s, Pollard was in his late 30s and was feeling the natural pressures to make the band even less a priority and shift his attention to his work as a school teacher to support his family. Bee Thousand and the releases that lead up to it are strange and free as if each song might be their last before becoming “real adults. You can hear the thought process. If this was it, there was no reason not to make it as weird and wild as they wanted. No one was listening anyway. Right? ht",

In rather rapid succession, the band, who werent even popular in their local bar scene, were hailed as geniuses by far-off artists and intellectuals. In rather quick succession, Guided By Voices suddenly found themselves driving out of Ohio to play to enthusiastic rooms in New York (of course, nothing in reality happens “suddenly. See the excellent book Closer You Are by Matthew Cutter for much more). Despite all the excitement, reports on the morale amongst the band during this time are conflicting and fittingly so. Despite the growing evidence that the dream he had been on the verge of abandoning was coming true, one can imagine that Pollard didnt want to get cocky. It seemed clear that this was the moment, his first and possibly last chance at being heard. To his credit, what he delivered sounded like the furthest thing from a pandering, sell-out record seeking mass appeal.

Just about every song, regardless of how incidental (some are only about a minute long), flows from an undeniably catchy hook, making the album, at least at first glance, feel like a catalog of demos, all of which could be expanded and made more palatable hits on 1990s rock radio. The caveat is, of course, the presentation. Every song seems to have been approached as a new experiment in eccentric home recording depending on what was going on at the Pollard residence that day (see the wild and pretty darn drunk process in the documentary Watch Me Jump Start directed by Banks Tarver). Tracks like “Smothered in Hugs” boom forth with roaring grunge distortion one moment and then shrink away to sound like the vocals are being shouted from another room. Electric and acoustic guitars are played with soulful vigor, whether creatively set in inventive tunings or carelessly out of tune altogether. Then there are Pollards notorious lyrics. “Oh, to speak on ones feet, to beat on ones brain, the popular mechanics are at it again” are lyrics that, on paper, look like gibberish, and maybe they are. Still, when sung by Pollard, they ring forth with soulful conviction, hinting at a poetry of feeling rather than definitive meaning. His surreal word games throughout the album call to mind psychedelia but also “brainier” things like the 1960s New York school of poets like John Ashberry and James Tate.

To this day, it has become a safer strategy for acts to roll their eyes and sneer at the guitar music they play, even if they and their audience obviously embrace it.

In other words, there have never really been any rules, and Guided By Voices know this instinctually.Bee Thousand is all at once shooting for the stars and grounded in the energy of the common and the everyday. The sometimes amateurish playing techniques (rock is supposed to be a little dumb) and the almost performatively off-putting recording experiments on the record can easily fascinate noise musicians and outsider obscurest alike. In less skillful hands, a track listing that pairs together the almost John Denver-styled campfire dirge, “The Gold Heart Mountaintop Queen Directory, alongside the post-punk scoldings of “Hot Freaks” would feel like a band without an identity. Still, instead, every ebb and flow comes at the listener like a dramatic beat in a greater narrative.The rock here constantly drips with a sort of X factor that leans toward a Magical Mystery Tour psychedelia, an energy that gives Bee Thousand the feeling of being a trip. The result is a record that is often listened to as one giant song by fans.

In the aftermath of sticking to their guns and making a weird album like Bee Thousand, they were able to quit their day jobs. However, plenty of deserving, brilliant artists will never see greater notoriety or monetary success.The legacy the story of Guided By Voices leaves behind will always be about remembering that some monetary success, and a vague idea of fame (in their case cult fame), is not what matters. Their example is one of a group of regular, everyday artists sharing their work in its most honest form, regardless of whether a crowded basement in Ohio was listening or the entire world was listening. Guided By Voices put in the work and felt the buzz from excited new converts, but as the weird and wooly Bee Thousand clearly stated, they would be remembered or forgotten for being exactly who they were.

Discs: 1 # Tracks: 0 Pressing: --> --> Images Front Cover Comments Foreword by Steven Soderbergh Description: Guided by Voices, the most influential and devoutly followed indie-rock band of the last decade, is examined in the very first officially authorized band biography by an insider and former Spin magazine editor. Guided by Voices was one of the most popular indie-rock bands of the 1990s and critics internationally lauded the band�s brain trust, Robert Pollard, as a once-in-a-generation artist. Says Rolling Stone, \"Songwriters who are lucky enough to come up with ten great melodies in their lifetime must hate Robert Pollard, who . . . does effortlessly what the rest of his brethren pursue to the point of frustration.\" \"Pollard is this millennium�s William Shakespeare: just as prolific, poetic, and powerful,\" says the Austin American-Statesman, and Entertainment Weekly raves, \"Robert Pollard writes the best melodies around, and his lyrics are consistently breathtaking in their surrealistic beauty.\" Guided by Voices is Robert Pollard (along with a shifting lineup of coconspirators). GbV, as they�re known to their legion of fans, has been lauded by The Times (London) as \"one of the greatest bands in the history of the world ever.\" Pollard has been compared by The New York Times to Mozart, Ro",

Led by songwriter and lead singer Robert Pollard, the Dayton, Ohio-based band recorded six self-released albums between 1986 and 1992 that attracted a handful of fans within the American indie rock underground. With the 1994 release of Bee Thousand, the group became an unexpected alternative rock sensation, winning positive reviews throughout the mainstream music press and signing a larger distribution deal with Matador Records. Initially, the bandmembers stuck to their aesthetic, continuing to record their albums on cheap four-track tape decks, but by 1999, Pollard recruited new bandmates, moved up to a larger label (TVT), and began working with name producers in real studios (Ric Ocasek was at the controls for Do the Collapse). Despite this, Pollard's melodic sensibilities changed very little, and when the band moved back to Matador for 2002's Universal Truths and Cycles, they learned to strike a middle ground between more professional technique and Pollard's spontaneous, compact songcraft.

But as their current lineup&#x27;s latest run of albums shows, they&#x27;re a band for right now.Morgan Enos|GRAMMYs/Jul 1, 2022 - 02:37 pmPresented by GRAMMY.com, Songbook is an editorial series and hub for music discovery that dives into a legendary artists discography and art in whole — from songs to albums to music films and videos and beyond. When an artist has been doing their thing for four decades, how is their classic era to be determined? For Robert Pollard, the calculus is simple. His long-running rock band, Guided by Voices, experienced their indie breakthrough in the early- to-mid-90s with a smattering of indelible, rough-hewn, heart-on-sleeve albums: Bee Thousand, Alien Lanes and Under the Bushes Under the Stars. So, take those classics, throw in a few before and after, and, boom — youve got a neat entryway for GBV beginners. But there are a couple of complicating factors at play. First, Pollard seems totally disinterested in the notion of a classic era. When he reignited the project in 2010 with the members from those three albums, he made derisive references to the so-called classic lineup and feared a relegation to the indie-throwback festival circuit. People at festivals dont want to hear a new album — they want to hear the greatest hits, Pollard told Magnet in 2014. And Im not that interested in that. Im more interested in what comes next. Despite making six reunion albums together, the so-called classic lineup di",

When Pollard rips into new songs like Excited Ones, his boyish enthusiasm is palpable; when its time for a 30-year-old song like Tractor Rape Chain, he can look like hes in line at the DMV. A Guided by Voices song from 2022 does not sound like one from 1992. Thanks in part to Pollards deepening writing — but also the musicians in his band — there are very few of the bands earlier one-minute, tape-recorded quasi-throwaways, which toggle between inchoate and inspired. Today, Pollard always completes his songs. And more often than not, theyre majestic. Case in point: their potent new album, Tremblers and Goggles by Rank, out July 1. A meditation on memory and loss in several movements, Alex Bell practically contains an albums worth of ideas on its own. Cartoon Fashion (Bongo Lake) is listed as an A-B-C-D suite on the album sleeve, like on the 70s prog albums that got Pollard going. And in all of three minutes, Focus on the Flock switches tempos, grooves, and even genres, all in the service of engaging dynamics and ascendant hooks. Perhaps a YouTube commenter on the Lizard on the Red Brick Wall video said it best: Peak GBV is now. And that arguably applies to their entire current era, featuring the lineup of guitarists Doug Gillard and Bobby Bare, Jr., bassist Mark Shue and drummer Kevin March.

Because songs like Amusement Park is Over, My Future in Barcelona, and Black and White Eyes in a Prism are, at the very least, just as good. In a unique edition of Songbook focusing on just one era of Pollards voluminous discography, heres a guide to a reconstituted Guided by Voices astonishing creative roll in the 2010s and 2020s. Please Be Honest (2016) While technically not the product of Guided by Voices current lineup — Pollard sang every vocal and played every instrument — Please Be Honest remains a crucial introduction to this modern phase of the band. Announced concurrently with Guided by Voices relaunch, Please Be Honest felt at the time like a recentering, a palate-cleansing, a recommitment to authenticity and sincerity. (Hell, its there in the title.) While reams of thrilling music would follow it, Please Be Honest remains addictive and compelling — not only for that aforementioned quality, but because of the strength of the songwriting. Plus, an eerie and loamy atmosphere, coupled with insectoid themes (see The Grasshopper Eaters and The Caterpillar Workforce ) helps it stick in your craw. Opener My Zodiac Companion detonates into one of Pollards most affecting choruses; Kid on a Ladder sets Buddy Holly-esque pop jubilation to a hammering drum machine; the murky-sounding yet clear-eyed titl",

It all ends with Eye Shop Heaven, where Pollard reaches into commanding, Eddie Vedder-esque depths of his register, before an unexpected flip into a sugary, Monkees-like coda. You are simply lying! Pollard sings. But on Please Be Honest, he never is. August by Cake (2017) Every GBV fan remembers where they were when they heard Pollards ringmasterly intro — Ladies and gentlemen! I present to you: August by Cake! — followed by an exultant horn fanfare. Because at that moment, Guided by Voices were not only back after years away: they gave us a double-album feast, like GBV lodestar the Whos Tommy or Quadrophenia. And on its own, the honest-to-god anthemic opener 5º On the Inside offers enough momentum to keep the listener engaged for 31 more tunes. But what tunes they are. The brief When We All Hold Hands at the End of the World bends a simple melody into earworm after earworm. The Gillard-written and -sung Goodbye Note pumps and slams with brute impact. Packing the Dead Zone is an excoriation of social media-age sloth with an unforgettable spoken-word intro by GBV associate (and NYPD veteran) Steven Stefanakos: Were creating a society of cell-phone-crazed, marijuana-smoking zombies! And by then, you’re only eight songs in. Take some time to kick around inside August by Cake, and youll likely come up with your own highlights.

    "text": ", suggesting childhood bygones, internal turbulence and lashings of violence. Clearly, Amusement Park is Over means something to Pollard: its the only August by Cake song remaining on their current setlists. How Do You Spell Heaven (2017) After the initiatory sprawl of August by Cake — a swirl of hi- and mid- and lo-fi — a renewed Guided by Voices honed their aesthetic with How Do You Spell Heaven. True to its cover art — featuring Pollard beholding an unearthly orb of light — this follow-up feels pure, focused and executed with aplomb. Mysterious sound effects, intentional recording mistakes and head-scratching interludes need not apply here. King 007 climbs staircases only to lapse into languid acoustic strums; the power-popping Diver Dan burns mellowly and consistently like a candlewick; Nothing Gets You Real is mellow, strummy and downcast. And even as closer Just To Show You ups the ante section-by-section, Pollard never gets swept into the drama — he sounds stony and undeterred. GBV would go on to make albums with more distinct peaks and valleys, but theres something to be said about this kind of entry — one that makes the bands detractors, who might view the ultra-productive band as unedited or unserious, eat crow. Space Gun (2018) Where August by Cake waded through volatile psychological waters and How Do You Spell Heaven felt philosophical and stoic, Space Gun is almost unerringly flashy, colorful and loud.

This leads to the goofy, almost AC/DC-like swagger of Colonel Paper, inspired by a real-life account of a drunken night eating chicken — and Pollards hometown buddy rooting through cigarette-filled garbage for a hangover snack. Space Gun keeps the energy percolating for 13 more songs, but its hardly one-note. Blink Blank is hypnotic, psychedelic and mantra-like; I Love Kangaroos is peppy and irresistible; Grey Spat Matters burns for a minute and a half with a vocal melody to die for. Near the end, we get Thats Good — a dead-earnest ballad culled from the archives and newly recorded with a string arrangement by Gillard (a talent that would reach full flower in ensuing years). All in all, Space Gun is a good one to reach for if you want utter immediacy from GBV — a quick hit, a sugar rush, a 38-minute whirl around the cosmos. Zeppelin Over China (2019) Craving the slicker side of GBV, stretched across four sides? Enter Zeppelin Over China, a weirdly under-discussed yet major work from this epoch of the band. As always, the pacing is ironclad: Good Morning Sir instantly wakes you up in a rush of anticipation, then Step of the Wave withholds, withholds, withholds until an exhilarating crescendo. As with any classic double album, the tunes keep flying by, with more gems lurking around every corner. Some are deliciously lumpy and impenetrable, like Blu",

While the whole hangs together gloriously, its up to a fans discretion as to whether any individual Zeppelin Over China tracks belong in the time capsule. That said, the album features two crown jewels that represent the apogee of Pollards powers. One is The Rally Boys, an update on the chest-beating camaraderie of yesteryears classics, like The Official Ironman Rally Song and Dont Stop Now. The ascendant chorus, a statement of purpose on Planet GBV, is meant to be beerily belted into your concert neighbors ear. It just feels good. The other is My Future in Barcelona, practically a doctoral thesis on the limitless power of human imagination. From a half-heard soccer-game announcement — something about the future of Barcelona — Pollard crafted an absolutely magical rock song, bursting with possibilities and expectation and longing and anything else you might want to map onto it. If you only check out one song from this article, make it this one. Who else can be so receptive to the din of daily life, enough to pull a song like this from the air? John Lennon could do it. Pollard can do it. And the message of My Future in Barcelona is seemingly that we can all do it. From all but thin air, we can make music.

Recorded on the fly during soundchecks, in hotel rooms and even while teetering on the bench of the van, Warp and Woof has an unadulterated quality that might appeal to fans of Guided by Voices most unpolished work from the early 90s (think Vampire on Titus). Emerging from the GarageBand-y hiss and noise are a handful of tunes that stick in the imagination, like the happy-go-lucky baroque-pop pastiche Photo Range Within and hammering pop song Blue Jay House. But from the hip-swinging My Angel to the melodically serpentine Cool Jewels and Aprons to the lovably lunkheaded My Dog Surprise, the highlights are yours to discern amid this curiosity-shop of an album. And as usual, the band would take a very different tack with the follow-up. Sweating the Plague (2019) Think of the consistent aesthetic of How Do You Spell Heaven and Zeppelin Over China. Then, apply it to a stripped-down, 12-song sequence and beef it up with a stadium-rock heft. Youll land within spitting distance of Sweating the Plague. Warp and Woofs far more traditional follow-up dispenses of almost everything one might find extraneous about Guided by Voices — left-field genre experiments, Pollard singing in funny voices, too many songs. No track could be reasonably cut; every decision lands. As on those two aforementioned spiritual cousins of GBV albums, that consistency can sometimes translate to a lack of clear highlights.

The next time you feel like youve waded out so far that your feet arent touching the bottom, heed Pollards counsel in the outro: Get some danger in your life/ And more ink in your tattoo. Surrender Your Poppy Field (2020) Another swing in the opposite direction, Surrender Your Poppy Field is an album of rough terrain, jagged edges and odd marriages of tones. Opener Year of the Hard Hitter sets the tone immediately — even after multiple listens, its hard to predict which direction the song will zip into. Volcano has a meaty, alt-rock chorus thats more Nirvana or Smashing Pumpkins than GBV. Moving forward, the seemingly tossed-off Queen Parking Lot belies a melody of Beatles-level sweetness; Woah Nelly is a drunken boat of ghostly Pollards; the woozy Andre the Hawk has an almost plasticine sparkle. The quiet triumph of Surrender Your Poppy Field, however, is Cul-de-Sac Kids, where a stately Jethro Tull-style introduction bursts unexpectedly into wondrous, double-time ebullience. By the time the Book of Revelation-like closer Next Sea Level subsumes the album, one walks away having experienced a one-of-a-kind — and wondrously scatterbrained — GBV experience.

    "text": " Band phase, think again. Mirrored Aztec — a summer album by design — is a tight and dry listen that nonetheless allows ample whimsy through. First, the wonderfully offbeat moments: Math Rock ridicules the titular subgenre with help from a childrens chorus; Haircut Sphinx is a brief, punch-drunk bar rocker; and Lip Curlers is a head-scratcher, even for these guys. Aside from the outliers, several of its tunes, like Citizens Blitz, wriggle about for a minute or two before peacing out. But a handful of them shine brightly, from the shone-up oldie Bunco Men to the radiant, 12-string-strummed To Keep an Area to the rowdy closing sequence, closing the curtain with Party Rages On. Styles We Paid For (2020) A high watermark of GBVs current run of albums, Styles We Paid For drives straight down the middle of the road, keeping the focus squarely on the songcraft. More than almost any album around it, this one lives right in the Goldilocks zone: just weird enough, just traditional enough, just enough tape hiss, just enough fidelity. The vibe is moody, philosophical, a tad paranoid. In other words, it hits a sweet spot for Guided By Voices. Styles We Paid For is also the GBV album that, intentionally or not, most reflects its times — specifically, the early pandemic. The band had recorded remotely for many albums at this point, but the jagged edges of that process show — gloriously.

Never Abandon Ship is permeated with steely-eyed resolve. And the beatific ballad Stops feels lost in reverie, awestruck at the power of song. But all that aside, the simple fact remains that the hitters really hit. The dirgelike anti-hit Slaughterhouse is deliciously sulky and morbid; the kinetic Mr. Child is seemingly about some Peter Pan-syndromed dervish; and Electronic Windows to Nowhere is one of the most gloriously melodic anti-tech bitch-fests in recent memory. Earth Man Blues (2021) Pollard arguably sold Earth Man Blues short when he called it a collage of rejected songs. Because what could have simply been their first album of 2021 turns out to be something like their Sgt. Pepper’s. This isnt just in the diversity of material, or the occasional psychedelic twist, or that its even presented as some tongue-in-cheek performance. Rather, its Pepper-ness comes from its profound longing for and curiosity about the past — and how that can chart a path into the future. During the demoing process, Pollard opted not to write new songs, but dig through old cassettes for material. They were all rejects from other projects, he told Louder Than War. I was somewhat astonished by a few of those finds. Like, Why did I not think this song was good enough? Read More: The Connected Citizens: How Guided By Voices Recorded ",

    "text": "Earth Man Blues Remotely During A Pandemic Indeed, they werent just good enough. Realized by his muscular current band, the Earth Man Blues tunes all but sum up what makes GBV great. The majestic The Disconnected Citizen evocatively references radiated halls and psychogenic fugues as the melody aims heavenward; The Batman Sees the Ball marries Television-like guitar interplay with a patient and bouncy groove; and the band throws the kitchen sink at Dirty Kid School, exploding a simple composition to cinematic effect. And so many other surprises lurk, including the warped, variety-show-style 60s-isms of Sunshine Girl Hello and the crepuscular How Can a Plumb Be Perfected? If this is what Pollard simply had lying around, how many other masterpieces could he make? Its Not Them. It Couldnt Be Them. It Is Them! (2021) Released about a week before Halloween, Its Not Them. It Couldnt Be Them. It Is Them! could represent the shadow of Earth Man Blues, featuring some of Pollards most immersive, arcane writing to date. Climb another wall over the mountain, he sings in opener Spanish Coin with a Fantean energy. Breathe in the force of experience. Then, something weve never heard at all on a Guided by Voices record: Spanish-influenced horns. Side one consists of kick-the-tires rockers ( High in the Rain ) and beatless, phantasmagorical experiments ( Maintenance Man of the Haunted House ). On top of that, the indisputable highlight Dance of Gurus is wound tight around a looping vocal line",

But from then on, its rock and roll time, with every string- and/or horn-laced track hitting harder than the last: From I Wanna Monkey into Cherub and the Great Child Actor into Black and White Eyes in a Prism. And the curtain-call, My (Limited) Engagement, is one of the all time great GBV closers — capped off by a spectacular guitar solo from Gillard. Crystal Nuns Cathedral (2022) Vaguely in the same galaxy as the streamlined How Do You Spell Heaven and Sweating the Plague, Crystal Nuns Cathedral shows how the band could reel back their experimentation yet, somehow, land in a deeper place. We approached this one with more of an eye to get slightly bigger sounds — slightly more homogenous throughout the album, Gillard told The Ash Grey Proclamation in 2022. And deliberately less idiosyncratic mixes than usual, perhaps. If this sounds like standard GBV, give it a chance — youll be surprised on multiple levels. For instance, the band had never recorded a song like Climbing a Ramp, building and building on a sawing cello line. Nor had they done anything like Forced to Sea, which materializes in a twilit, ambient soundfield. Plus, Pollards lyrics on Crystal Nuns Cathedral hit harder than usual. Nothing moves me like this, he admits in the gorgeous, mid-tempo rocker Never Mind the List. And in Excited Ones, a galloping rocker about those who wrap their arms around life: They crush it every day!",

Tremblers and Goggles By Rank (2022) This is no exaggeration: all the various GBVs represented in the above albums — the goofy, the intrepid, the moody, the plucky, the experimental, the pensive — are reflected in Tremblers and Goggles By Rank. Want to be pummeled with galactic kabooms, like on Space Gun? Dig the flangered vortex of Lizard on the Red Brick Wall. Want bittersweetness that hits from multiple angles, like on Earth Man Blues? Alex Bell and Unproductive Funk will send you. Interior explorations a la Styles We Paid For? Boomerang and Who Wants to Go Hunting? Guided by Voices are often defined by their prolificity, but lets face it: fans are getting both quality and quantity. And live performances get a dozen times the reaction for oldies like Game of Pricks than something like Stops, but its time to knock that down too. The fact that even some professed fans sleep on the new stuff doesnt dim the reality one iota: Guided by Voices are a band for right now. And their still-ravenous cult fanbase wont fault you for getting on the train late.

    "text": "e Relief Effort To Support Music Professionals. Editor’s Note: This interview was conducted before the onset of the wildfires in Los Angeles. Steve Cropper is still selling energy — putting forth what a younger generation might call blues rock vibes with his pals as if it were still 1970. This ethos dates back to his time at the legendary Memphis label Stax Records, where Cropper served as a songwriter, producer, engineer and A R. Crucially, Cropper was the guitarist in Staxs house band, Booker T. The MGs — they of Green Onions fame — and backed artists including Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Sam Dave, and Carla Thomas. Among his many bonafides, Cropper co-wrote Reddings (Sittin’ On) The Dock Of The Bay. In his post-Stax years, the two-time GRAMMY winner and nine-time nominee produced and played on sessions with Jeff Beck, Jose Feliciano, John Prine, John Cougar, and Tower Of Power. He later joined Levon Helm’s RCO All-Stars group and was among the original members in Dan Aykroyd and John Belushis Blues Brothers band. Cropper resumed his solo career in the 80s, releasing several albums, while continuing to collaborate with leading lights like Paul Simon, Ringo Starr, Elton John and Steppenwolf. Steve Cropper has stayed true to himself for over seven decades, thanks in no small part to advice from Stax founder Jim Stewart. He said, Just play yourself and if they dont like it, theyll tell you, Cropper tells GRAMMY.com. So Ive been playing myself all my life and its worked out. ",

    "text": "Thats pretty cool. At the 2025 GRAMMYs, Cropper is nominated in the Best Contemporary Blues Album Category for the aptly named Friendlytown, recorded with a mix of long-time collaborators and a few newer faces, together billed as Steve Cropper the Midnight Hour. Friendlytowns 13 tracks are familiar, digestible and straight-ahead rockin — the kind of tunes youd be thrilled to hear in a local dive. Featuring ZZ Tops Billy Gibbons, Queen guitarist Brian May, singer Roger C Reale, and guitarist Tim Montana, Cropper co-wrote and co-produced all of Friendlytown with bassist Jon Tiven. Steves guitar playing on the song Hurry Up Sundown is probably some of his best solo work and rhythm work, Tiven says. Its amazing that at this point in his career, he could still be creating some of the greatest music of his life. I think thats a wonderful testament to the strength of his talent. Meet Me At The Friendlytown Trader Joes There was very little methodical music-making behind Friendlytown, which partially grew out of sessions Cropper put together for his 2021 album Fire It Up. This record was just about a bunch of guys getting together and having some fun. Its just like, Lets have a blast and try to make the party come to the record, rather than the record come to the party, Tiven notes. Cropper and Tiven had been working on songs for years with the hopes of finding friendly musicians to give them life. While some found homes, the duo sat on instrumentals for years — until Tiven ran into ",

    "text": "Billy Gibbons at Trader Joes. When Tiven told the sharp-dressed man he was making a record with Steve Cropper, He just lit up like a firecracker and said hed like to bring us a song. I said, Well, its only going on the record unless you play on it. And he said, Well, that could be arranged. Gibbons ended up on 11 tracks; Friendlytown marks the first time he and Cropper worked together in many years. The ZZ Top vocalists influence is audible on the album, particularly the title track and Eliminator-esque Lay It On Down. In Session At Stax While casual may be the name of Croppers game these days, it definitely wasnt 35, 40 years ago, he says. Back then (and largely before, as Cropper left the label in 1970), making music was was very serious, and I dont even think the guys had a good time. With a laugh, Cropper recalls his best friend, the Stax bassist/MG Duck Dunn, pining for a world in which Jim Stewart wouldve only smiled every now and then. While Cropper calls Stewart the greatest guy Ive ever met, the label head was known to be critical. He knew if you fought for something, like a song, that it was a good song. And if you didnt fight for it, it wasnt worth nothing, Cropper says, chuckling. He was right. I think about that all the time, but I dont use it. A songwriter could tell me how good a song they wrote is, but if I dont like it, I dont like it. Im sorry!. Im sure Ive thrown away some good ones before.

    "text": "ds A young Cropper put up a couple of fights, and for good reason. He recalls stumping for Wilson Picketts Ninety-nine and a half : [Jim Stewart said] You boys was out there woodsheddin’. That song aint going to make it. Cropper pressed it, and Stewart relented. The track made the cut for Picketts 1966 album The Exciting Wilson Pickett. Another big Stax hit stayed on the shelf for nine months while Cropper and co. battled it out with Stax brass. Finally Al Bell went to Jim and said, You got to put this record out. Its called ‘Knock on Wood. And Jim says, Okay, but you got to use your own money, Cropper says. He hated that record until it was a hit. Reflecting on the hardest song hes ever played, Cropper quickly points to Sam and Daves Soul Man. But the 1967 smash isnt difficult for the reasons you might think: the guitarist had to balance a Zippo lighter on his leg during sessions and performances, which he used to mimic the songs opening horn line. I always had to dance [when recording] with Sam and Dave, because they could hit a groove. A lot of guitar players dont know that I played with a Zippo lighter and Id slide it, he recalls. Cropper reportedly hated the sound and feel of new guitar strings — something, he says, is no longer the case in old age — and in a lip-smacking good tidbit of studio lore, explained how he managed his unique sound. I carry a thing of ChapStick all the time and I would go up and down the strings; [that would] take about three months out of the s",

    "text": "tring so it would sound like the rest of them. Sittin On A Legacy After decades in the business, it seems as if Cropper – though ever a professional – doesnt take himself or the creative process too seriously. He jokingly shares a reccolation from a studio session during his Stax years: Once the session was finished, Cropper told the group Damn, this sounds like a hit. And Al Jackson said, Steve, theyre all hits until theyre released. Hes probably right. One of Staxs reliable hitmakers was a close friend of Croppers: Otis Redding. The two shared a deep musical bond and some shared history. Both musicians grew up on farms ( By the time I was 14, I was ready to leave the home. By the time I was 16, I was gone in my mind, Cropper notes) yet the guitarist describes Redding as most streetwise person that I ever met. I think he just had it. It came natural to him. Redding played guitar with one finger and you never argued with Otis — especially because he was never available for sessions for more than a day or two. Most Otis Redding albums, as a result, were compilations from different sessions. I remember we cut I Cant Turn You Loose in 10 minutes, Cropper says. [When we recorded] Otis Blue, we had everybody come back at 1 [a.m.] -- after they did their gig and they went home and had their shower – so we could cut it. Cropper knew that (Sittin On) The Dock Of The Bay — arguably Reddings biggest hit, and Croppers first GRAMMY win — was a hit. You know why I knew it was a hit? Becau",

    "text": "se we had Otis the longest Id had him; for two weeks. The gentle lull of Sittin was a radical departure from Reddings Southern soul bombast, and perhaps a sign of what was to come if the singer hadnt died tragically in a plane crash. That one song, we searched for a long time. We call it crossover music; so it could go either way:, R B, pop, whatever. That was the first one we ever had, Cropper says. Theres Always A Catch Steve Cropper is still going strong at 83 years old. He reports that he enjoyed HBOs recent Stax Records docuseries, and has an unfinished instrumentals album in the can. He hasnt time for regrets, only dreams, but the name of the one person Cropper wishes he had worked with fires off like lightning: Tina Tuner. Cropper saw the late legend three times. I really did admire Tina. She was the closest person to Otis, I think, in the business. Its the yeller, screamer, but everybody loves their music. She was so good, it didnt matter how it was shes yelling and screaming, he says. Tina Turners loudest albums still have melody and something people will walk away humming — the very thing Cropper loved about Stax records. We were selling groove and all, rather than the music, Cropper says of his work with the MGs. We dont care about the music. We just cared about melody and whats in the simplicity of the song. 2025 GRAMMYs: Performances, Acceptance Speeches Highlights2025 GRAMMYs: See The Full Winners Nominees ListFeb 3, 2025Watch Performances Highlights From The 20",

For his take on this timeless Christmas carol, the Cliffs Of Dover guitarist intermingles acoustic-based lines, sublime clean guitar passages and Hendrix-y double-stops with his trademark creamy violin-like Strat lines. The result is a sonic equivalent on par with the majesty of the Rockefeller Christmas tree. (For more dazzling holiday guitar tomfoolery, look into the album its featured on, 1997s Merry Axemas.) Who doesnt want a large semiaquatic mammal for the holidays? For then-10-year-old child star Gayla Peevey, not only did she score with the catchy tune, she also got her wish. The 1953 novelty hit, written by John Rox, rocketed up the pop charts and led to a fundraising campaign to buy Peevey an actual hippo for Christmas. Children donated their dimes to the cause, and the Oklahoma City native got her hippo, named Mathilda, which she donated to the Oklahoma City Zoo. The song itself features plo",

It seems Peevey still has a fond legacy with the hippo activist community — she was on hand in 2017 when the Oklahoma City Zoo acquired a pygmy hippopotamus. In a contemplative mood this Christmas? Try getting into the holiday spirit by way of meditating on the true meaning of the season with this brash, uptempo Southern California crust punk tune. Now the best-known song from the Vandals 1996 Christmas album of the same name, Oi To The World! remained a relatively obscure track by the Huntington Beach punkers until it was covered by a rising pop/ska crossover band from nearby Anaheim, Calif., in 1997. (Perhaps you have heard of them — they were called No Doubt.) Ever since, the song has been a mainstay of the Vandals live sets, and they have also played the album Oi To The World! in its entirety every year since its release at their annual Winter Formal show in Anaheim, now in its 29th year. Though its best known from OutKasts 1994 debut album, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, the Christmas version of the track Players Ball was released earlier on A LaFace Family Christmas, an L.A. Reid-led project to introduce new acts. The then-young Atlanta rapper duo took a Southern hip-hop spin on the season, which can come across as a little irreverent, but at least theyre honest: Aint no chimneys in the ghetto so I wont be hangin my socks on no c",

Youd be hard-pressed to find a more heartbreaking Christmas story than this Tom Waits masterpiece from 1978s Blue Valentine. Charlie, Im pregnant and living on 9th Street, begins the Christmas card narrative in which a woman writes to an old flame, reporting how much better things are going since she quit drugs and alcohol and found a trombone-playing husband. Waits signature early career piano-plinking and tall-tale-storytelling weaves through a dream world of hair grease and used car lots, even sneaking in a Little Anthony And The Imperials reference. In the end, our narrator comes clean with the sobering lyric, I dont have a husband, he dont play the trombone before pleading, I need to borrow money to pay this lawyer and Charlie hey, Ill be eligible for parole come Valentines Day. For the uninitiated, this is the off-beat genius of GRAMMY winner Waits at his finest. Though they took some lumps in their 80s hair-metal heyday, few would dare deny Wingers talent and musicianship. Surely on display here, frontman Kip Winger (a GRAMMY-nominated classical musician) and his bandmates begin with a traditional unplugged reading of the Franz Xaver Gruber-penned holiday chestnut, complete with four-part harmony.

Its therefore no surprise that Cyndi Lauper and Swedish rock band the Hives unconventional Christmas duel describes many marital hiccups that might make some blush. Yet, the raucous duet somehow comes out on a high note, concluding, We should both just be glad/And spend this Christmas together. The 2008 track was the brainchild of the Hives, who always wanted to do a song with Lauper. This is a Christmas song whose eggnog has been spiked with acid, and whose definition of holiday cheer comes with a complimentary kick below the belt, wrote Huffington Post in 2013. Its also an absolute riot. Leave it to LCD Soundsystems producer/frontman James Murphy to pen a holiday song about the depressing side of the season. If your world is feeling small/ Theres no one on the phone/ You feel close enough to call, he sings, tapping into that seasonal weirdness that can creep up, especially as everything around you is incessant smiles, warmth and cheer, and pumpkin-spice lattes. While he doesnt shy away from examining the depressing side of surviving the holiday season as an aging 20-, 30-, 40-something, Murphy does at least give a glimmer of hope to grab onto, transient and fleeting though it",

Two years later, Lamar circles back to celebrate the west on 2024s GNX, a 12-track release that revels in the root of his love for hip-hop and California culture, from the lowriders to the rappers that laid claim to the golden state. “My baby boo, you either heal n—s or you kill n—s/ Both is true, it take some tough skin just to deal with you” Lamar raps on gloria featuring SZA, a track that opines on his relationship with the genre. The Compton-born rapper (who was born Kendrick Lamar Duckworth) wasnt always championed as King Kendrick. In hip-hop, artists have to earn that moniker, and Lamars enthroning occurred in 2013 when he delivered a now-infamous verse on Big Seans Control. Im Makavelis offspring, Im the King of New York, King of the Coast; one hand I juggle em both, Lamar raps before name-dropping some of the top rappers of the time, from Drake to J.Cole. Whether youve been a fan of Lamar since before his crown-snatching verse or you find yourself in need of a crash course on the 37-year-old rappers illustrious career, GRAMMY.com answers nine questions that will paint the picture of Lamars more than decade-long reign. Who Discovered Kendrick Lamar?

Lamars first mixtape in 2004 was enough for Tiffiths Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) to offer the aspiring rapper a deal with the label in 2005. However, Lamar would later learn that Tiffiths impact on his life dates back to multiple encounters between his father and the TDE founder, which Lamar raps about in his 2017 track DUCKWORTH.

After five albums, four mixtapes, one compilation project, an EP, and a GRAMMY-nominated Black Panther: The Album, Kendrick Lamar and Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) confirmed that Mr. Morale The Big Steppers was the Compton rappers last project under the iconic West Coast label. According to Lamar, his departure was about growth as opposed to any internal troubles. May the Most High continue to use Top Dawg as a vessel for candid creators. As I continue to pursue my lifes calling, Lamar wrote on his website in August 2021. Theres beauty in completion. TDE president Punch expressed a similar sentiment in an interview with Mic. We watched him grow from a teenager up into an established grown man, a businessman, and one of the greatest artists of all time, he said. So its time to move on and try new things and venture out. Before Lamars official exit from TDE, he launched a new venture called pgLang — a multi-disciplinary service company for creators, co-founded with longtime collaborator Dave Free — in 2020.

The fact is that GBV isnt so much a band as it is an idea invented by Robert Pollard in 1983. A schoolteacher who started writing songs for fun as a music-obsessed teenager, Pollard made music in obscurity for nearly a decade before anyone outside of his immediate circle of friends and bandmates started to care. By the time he became the subject of magazine profiles in the mid-90s, he was a husband and father whose 40th birthday loomed on the horizon.

This explains why there are at least as many songs in Pollards life as there are mornings lived. If you know anything about Guided By Voices, its probably at least one of the following factoids: 1) Their most famous recordings are lo-fi, which is a succinct way of saying sonically reminiscent of a cassette that has been run through a washing machine for two hours; 2) Their songs have very long and convoluted titles (like Burning Flag Birthday Suit or 14 Cheerleader Cold Front); 3) They have a ton (and I mean a ton) of albums. That last one is GBVs calling card and Achilles Heel. Pollards compulsion to create has resulted in a catalog that feels more spontaneous and alive than any of his contemporaries. But it also makes their catalog daunting to anyone who is not already a committed Pollard disciple. This has automatically limited the bands reach. With Pavement, its easy to know where to start: Go to Slanted And Enchanted, and then proceed through the discography from there. With GBV, however — between all of the albums and EPs and solo albums and side projects — there are dozens upon dozens of releases to sift through. How does one wade into the world of GBV?

    "text": "er to Guided By Voices is bound to be intimidated by the seemingly endless number of possible entry points. But the good news is that practically everyone who cares about this band agrees on the GBV albums that are most essential. I refer to the mid-90s trilogy composed of 1994s Bee Thousand, 1995s Alien Lanes, and 1996s Under The Bushes Under The Stars. Reasonable people might disagree on which one of the three is the best, but heading here first is unquestionably the most obvious (and best) starting point for neophytes. Bee Thousand is the one that turned GBV into an indie phenomenon. Released on the tiny independent label Scat, the album garnered ecstatic raves from critics — it even landed at No. 8 on the Village Voices Pazz Jop critics poll, just ahead of major-label alt-rock behemoths like Nine Inch Nails The Downward Spiral, Becks Mellow Gold, Soundgardens Superunknown, and Green Days Dookie. Pollard conceived Bee Thousand as a kind of greatest hits album, in which he pulled songs from throughout his life in order to create the ultimate representation of his work up to that point. He wanted it to sound like a collection of fuzzed-out Beatles outtakes, though what Pollard actually presented was a classic rock album in which the bootleg is the record, like if Brian Wilson had just put out the demos of Pet Sounds in the place of the actual Pet Sounds. As a lyricist, Pollard came on like a hybrid of mid-60s Dylan at his most obscure and early 70s Peter Gabriel at his most ",

His talent for pure abstraction did not get in the way of delivering emotional payoffs — no matter how difficult it might be to explain on paper the resonance of a song like Gold Heart Mountaintop Queen Directory, on record it communicates a deeper and unknowable kind of power and truth, due almost entirely to the conviction of Pollards vocal and his commitment to world-building. Mystery was key to GBVs initial appeal. Pollards songs were catchy but inscrutable, both sonically and lyrically. The band members themselves were also enigmatic. Bee Thousand did not include a band photo, and the backstory about these workaday, 30something-year-old guys who magically transformed themselves into swaggering rock stars amid the shadows and grime of an Ohio garage lent them instant mystique. Even in the 90s, there was suspicion about nepo babies always cornering the market on next big thing status. GBV was about as far removed from that as anyone could imagine, then or now. They were like the Beatles if the Beatles were hard-drinking Midwesterners who lived next door with mortgages and boring day jobs. They were, for lack of a better term, authentic. Guided By Voices was already on the radar of Matador Records before Bee Thousand, thanks to the evangelizing of early super-fans like Matt Sweeney of Chavez as well as a career-making performance at the iconic Manhattan club CBGBs in the summer of 1993.

    "text": "t GBV didnt make their Matador debut until Alien Lanes, a 28-song epic that unfolds in a brisk 41 minutes. Once again forgoing a traditional recording studio, Pollard and his compatriots — including Tobin Sprout, his most important collaborator at the time and the bands George Harrison figure — turned out songs in a primitive basement set-up at a rapid, beer-fueled pace. The final result is even more formally daring than Bee Thousand, piling a series of short pop songs on top of each other in a manner that sometimes seems reckless and chaotic. But this was by design, and if you get on its singular wavelength, listening to Alien Lanes feels like a record-collecting savant rearranging rock history and running it through a blender laced with sugar and shrapnel. The final album in the mid-aughts trilogy, Under The Bushes Under The Stars, registered at the time as Pollards attempt to make a big rock record. Though when heard more than 25 years later, it sounds like a slightly (but only slightly) more polished update of the previous two albums. Perhaps because the release was followed by the dissolution of GBVs classic lineup — not the original lineup, as we will discuss in a minute — Under The Bushes tends to not get the same shine as Bee Thousand and Alien Lanes. But in terms of songs, it is very much in the same league as those other records. Cut-Out Witch, The Official Iron Man Rally Song, Bright Paper Werewolves, Your Name Is Wild, Dont Stop Now — these are rock anthems that g",

Beyond the mid-aughts trilogy, I would put three more albums in the GBV 101 category. Two of them immediately precede the trilogy: 1992s Propeller and 1993s Vampire On Titus. While Bee Thousand broke them with the wider critical community, Propeller and Vampire On Titus were the ones that got early tastemakers like Sweeney on board, setting up that gig at CBGBs during the CMJ Festival. At the time, Guided By Voices was such a non-entity in their own town that they hadnt played live in six years. The reception was so dispiriting that Pollard originally conceived Propeller as his swan song. Though you wouldnt know it listening to the record — part of the reason Propeller broke through is that along with being GBVs most consistent collection of songs up that point, it has an arena-rock exuberance that the bands early work doesnt have, starting with the G!B!V! chant that opens the first track, Over The Neptune/Mesh Gear Fox. Pollard disbanded Guided By Voices after Propeller, so when the album caught on outside of Dayton he was left to record Vampire On Titus with his brother Jim and his faithful sidekick Tobin Sprout. Because they had no drummer, Pollard took over timekeeping duties himself, giving the songs a caveman stomp that makes Meg White sound like Buddy Rich. The album overall is noisy and diss",

The last album that belongs in GBV 101 is the best entry point for listeners who cant stomach the lo-fi sonics of the aforementioned records: 2001s Isolation Drills. After a series of records in the late 90s in which Pollard tried to make himself into a relatively conventional indie-rock star on par with peers like Stephen Malkmus or Wayne Coyne, Isolation Drills arrived as the most complete realization of normal rock band GBV. Now, instead of creating a bombed-out bootleg spin on Whos Next, Pollard made rock music nearly as towering and hard-hitting as any classic-rock masterpiece. It was a triumph in nearly every way except for (possibly) the most crucial, at least from a commercial perspective: It didnt make GBV an arena-rock band (or even a large theater band). After Isolation Drills, Pollard stop trying to be a rock star and focused on plying his committed cult following with an endless bounty of songs. In the 2005 book Guided By Voices: A Brief History, author (and one-time GBV bassist) James Greer tracks down Pete Townshend to ask his opinion of GBV. Pete, sadly, says the band is not my cup of tea, which prompts a dismissive (and defensive) reaction from Pollard. (Pollard has also ranted about this on stage.) Hopefully, Pete will one day hear Isolation Drills. GBV ADVANCED STUDIES I discovered GBV from reading the review of Alien Lanes in Rolling Stone, which supposedly is the ",

This is partly due to the review also covering Box, a collection of the bands first four albums: 1987s Devil Between My Toes, 1988s Sandbox, 1989s Self-Inflicted Aerial Nostalgia, and 1990s Same Place The Fly Got Smashed, as well as the early outtakes collection King Shit And The Golden Boys. (It does not include 1986s Forever Since Breakfast, their debut EP later packaged in the 2003 box set Hardcore UFOs: Revelations, Epiphanies and Fast Food in the Western Hemisphere.) The Guided By Voices you hear on those early albums is much different from the one that rose to prominence in the mid-90s. Starting out on Forever Since Breakfast as a jangly power-pop group clearly indebted to R.E.M., GBV take a darker, artier turn on the Box era albums as Pollard tries to master his blue collar loser genius aesthetic on a part-time basis while juggling family, his teaching job, and a constantly shifting lineup of support musicians. At this time, there were no hip NYC scenesters around to assure him his music was amazing. On the contrary, Pollards obsession with songwriting and making records prompted skepticism and even scorn from most of his peers in Dayton. And you can hear that in the music, which exudes alienation even on the poppy numbers. At times, Self-Inflicted Aerial Nostalgia sounds like Joy Divisions Closer if it had been transplanted to Ohio, particularly the menacing lead-off track The Future Is In Eggs. Pollard literalized the",

    "text": " musical dislocation of Self-Inflicted Aerial Nostalgia on the next album, crafting Same Place The Fly Got Smashed as a concept LP about an alcoholic who commits murder and is subsequently executed. The most pivotal track is Drinkers Peace, which opens with Pollard singing, At times I wish I was dead. It would be a mistake to interpret this as a self-portrait, but there is nevertheless a striking contrast here between the shit yeah, its cool!-style joy of the mid-90s material (as well as much of the work that came afterward) and the music Pollard made when his talent was unrecognized and denigrated. This period of GBV is fascinating for many reasons, but the primary one for me is that it shows from the beginning that Robert Pollard was a unique artist. While he was obsessed with rock history, he never recycled sounds of the past in the manner of so many trad-rock groups. Even when GBV draws upon their most obvious influences — The Beatles, The Who, Wire, Genesis — they never sound like any of those bands. Pollard is just as difficult to pin down philosophically as a beer-drinking ex-jock who also has encyclopedic knowledge of every important (and important only to him) art-rock record ever made. Ass-kicking and cerebral, conceptual and instinctual, intellectual and anti-intellectual — GBVs music is neither broadly appealing heartland rock nor niche-y cool-kid indie but something that resolutely exists outside of that binary. It has one foot in the bowling alley, and another f",

On that count, Im going to stump for two underrated late 90s LPs, 1997s Mag Earwhig! and 1999s Do The Collapse. This is where Pollard tinkered with the sort of chunky rock jams template that he perfected on Isolation Drills without completely shedding the micro-sized digressions that defined the mid-90s period. It was during this time that Pollard also hooked up with guitarist Doug Gillard, his most important bandmate after Tobin Sprout and a similarly reliable foil to his most indulgent tendencies. I started attending GBV shows regularly around this time, and no matter how drunk the rest of the band might get on stage Gillard always functioned as a kind of designated driver, making sure to guide the band back from sloshed to splendid in the space of a single song as needed. Gillards first run with Pollard in GBV carried through two fine post-Isolation Drills efforts, 2002s Universal Truths And Cycles and 2003s Earthquake Glue. The following year, Pollard disbanded GBV and focused on his solo career and various side projects for several years. (Even though, in reality, there is virtually no difference between his GBV work and his solo work — its all essentially Robert Pollard music.) In 2010, he reformed the classic lineup of GBV with Sprout, guitarist Mitch Mitchell, bassist Greg Demos, and drummer Kevin Fennell, though that eventually folded again after a few ",

    "text": "years. (The best album from this era, 2012s Class Clown Spots A UFO, nevertheless isnt quite as exciting as seeing this incarnation of the band live, especially for those of us who thought we would never see it.) Heres one of the many points in GBV history where things threaten to become way too convoluted for a newcomer (or even a casual fan) to follow. For now, Im going to be slightly reductive and point out that Gillard re-entered the GBV orbit in 2016 as a last-minute sub in the current GBV lineup formed by Pollard after he made Please Be Honest, a quite good sorta-comeback he recorded by himself under the band name. With Gillard back in the fold, GBV has had what many diehards consider to be a late-career golden age, with 2018s Space Gun, 2021s Earth Man Blues, and 2022s Tremblers And Goggles By Rank delivering especially focused and cogent rock songs within enjoyably sprawling contexts and concepts. GBV PH.D Like I said, all GBV music is Robert Pollard music, and vice versa. Which means if you have gotten this far without losing your appetite for more GBV music, you will definitely want to dig into his solo records. Two of Pollards best, 1996s Not In My Airforce and 1998s Waved Out, sound like companions to the GBV records he was making at the time. Sprout also put out several fine solo efforts in the wake of leaving GBV in 1996, the best of which is 1997s Moonflower Plastic, in which he sets his amiably reedy tenor against stately piano melodies to create some of the m",

    "text": "ost flat-out most beautiful music to come out of the GBV-adjacent canon. The line between GBV and Pollard gets even blurrier with 1999s Speak Kindly Of Your Volunteer Fire Department, an excellent collection co-credited to Gillard that might be even better than the two late 90s GBV albums from this period. Certainly Pop Zeus sounds like a potential hit that never was. Speak Kindly is among the earliest releases of the Fading Captain Series, a group of 44 albums released between 1999 and 2007 that became a clearinghouse for Pollards wildest and least commercial ideas. At times during this period, Pollard seemed more invested in his experiments than his proper band. For every album like 2001s relatively straightforward and rocking Choreographed Man Of War, there are scores of side projects that sound more in line with the cacophonous GBV albums of the 80s than the contemporary GBV of the early aughts. Even devotees by now had trouble keeping up with, say, the latest Lexo And The Leapers release, though sometimes the most committed were rewarded with a song as great as Alone, Stinking And Unafraid from 1999s Ask Them. If the prospect of 44 albums released in an eight-year period as a side hustle sounds daunting, allow me to introduce you to 2000s Suitcase: Failed Experiments And Trashed Aircraft, a 100-song box set compiling tracks going back to the mid-70s (including Pollards earliest recorded material) that somehow hadnt already ended up on a GBV-affiliated album.

The fabricated band names given to each individual track speak to the hyper-insularity of the exercise. But for those who are maniacally captivated by Pollards inexhaustible muse, its hard not to admire this mans unshakable faith in his ability to create musical worlds that are constantly surprising and utterly idiosyncratic. EXTRA CREDIT Banks Tarvers 1996 documentary Watch Me Jumpstart is hardly comprehensive — its only 36 minutes long, or about the length of a typical GBV album — but it shows Pollard and the classic lineup in their initial flash of indie fame as well as the guys hanging out in Dayton. For a more in-depth history of the band, Matthew Cutters 2018 biography Closer You Are: The Story Of Robert Pollard and Guided By Voices is a good read, particularly on those mysterious pre-Bee Thousand years. For all of the music that Pollard has committed to tape, a case could be made that Guided By Voices is best experienced live. The band has released several live albums, though the one thats most readily available, 2007s Live From Austin, TX, is by far the weakest. Two semi-bootleg live LPs from the mid-90s, 1994s Crying Your Knife Away and 1996s Jellyfish Reflector, showcase the classic lineups boozy camaraderie and offhand rock power, though they can be hard to track down.

Led by the beer-guzzling leader Robert Pollard, the group always sidestepped the zeitgeist and followed their creative mastermind’s sense of what music should be. Reflecting the extent of Pollard’s individualism, the band make a solid claim to being the most prolific outfit of all time, with the frontman having thousands of pieces registered to his name.Hailed as lo-fi pioneers, this restrictive reading of their career actually diminishes the heights Guided by Voices reached. The band have never placed the restrictions of one genre on themselves, creating a kind of fusion that is wholly unique. In just one song, there can be the melodies of 1960s bubblegum pop, the grit of 1980s hardcore punk, and folk-rock inflexions reminiscent of The Byrds. At points, electronic instruments have also had a defining impact. They have brought to life some of their most cherished pieces, including ‘Teenage FBI’ from 1995’s Do the Collapse. The song utilises a viscous keyboard arpeggio at the introduction, no doubt inspired by the album’s producer, Ric Ocasek of The Cars, who was an early master of",

When he sang, “I am a scientist – I seek to understand me / All of my impurities and evils yet unknown / I am a journalist – I write to you to show you / I am an incurable / And nothing else behaves like me,” in the first verse of ‘The Scientist’, he was accurate. Never has there been a better description of his work.With Guided by Voices having such an extensive history, there are many moments of note. To Robert Pollard, though, he thinks their “defining point” came in 1987, just before releasing their debut album, Devil Between My Toes.Setting a precedent for the DIY brilliance that was to follow, the album was self-recorded on an eight-track in their friend Steve Wilbur’s garage. Although he played on some parts of the record, guitarist Tobin Sprout quit the band and moved to Florida, leaving it to Pollard, bassist Mitch Mitchell and drummer Kevin Fennell to complete the work. Despite Sprout’s departure, Pollard still feels that it is one of the band’s finest moments, saying that was where he “changed everything”.“That’s where I changed everything,” Pollard told Exclaim in 2006. “It is where we really started making records for ourselves. Without a doubt, it is the defining point for GBV at that time.” Hitting their creative stride, by the end of the year, Guided by Voices had recorded their second album, Sandbox, in Steve Wilbur’s garage again.
